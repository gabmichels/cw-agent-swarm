# Baseline Validation Test Suite - Phase 0

This directory contains comprehensive baseline tests to validate the functionality of all existing tool systems before beginning the unified tools foundation implementation.

## Purpose

Before implementing the unified tools foundation, we need to:
1. **Document current functionality** - Understand what each system does
2. **Establish performance baselines** - Know current performance characteristics
3. **Prevent regressions** - Ensure no functionality is lost during migration
4. **Map system interactions** - Document how systems currently interact (or fail to)

## Test Structure

### System-Specific Tests
- `workspace-tools.test.ts` - Tests for workspace email, calendar, spreadsheet, file operations
- `social-media-tools.test.ts` - Tests for social media posting, TikTok, analytics
- `thinking-tools.test.ts` - Tests for ULID-based thinking system tools
- `agent-toolmanager.test.ts` - Tests for agent tool registration and health monitoring
- `apify-tools.test.ts` - Tests for dynamic actor registration and web scraping
- `external-workflows.test.ts` - Tests for N8n, Zapier workflow integration
- `approval-systems.test.ts` - Tests for workspace and social media approval workflows

### Cross-System Tests
- `cross-system-integration.test.ts` - Tests current cross-system interactions (mostly failures)
- `string-literal-mapping.test.ts` - Maps all string literal usage across systems
- `fallback-executor-patterns.test.ts` - Documents fallback executor usage patterns

### Performance Tests
- `performance-baselines.test.ts` - Establishes performance benchmarks for all systems
- `memory-usage.test.ts` - Measures memory usage patterns
- `startup-time.test.ts` - Measures initialization time for each system

### Infrastructure Tests
- `test-harnesses/` - Reusable test utilities for each system
- `mocks/` - Mock implementations for external services
- `fixtures/` - Test data and fixtures

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all baseline tests
npm run test:baseline

# Run specific system tests
npm run test:baseline:workspace
npm run test:baseline:social-media
npm run test:baseline:thinking
npm run test:baseline:apify

# Run cross-system tests
npm run test:baseline:cross-system

# Run performance baselines
npm run test:baseline:performance

# Generate baseline report
npm run test:baseline:report
```

## Test Categories

### ðŸŸ¢ Functional Tests
- Verify all tools execute correctly with expected inputs
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Validate output formats and data structures

### ðŸŸ¡ Integration Tests
- Test system interactions and dependencies
- Verify permission and capability validation
- Test approval workflows and user interactions

### ðŸ”´ Performance Tests
- Measure execution times for all tools
- Monitor memory usage during operations
- Establish throughput and concurrency baselines

### ðŸ”µ Documentation Tests
- Generate comprehensive tool inventories
- Map all tool names, IDs, and parameters
- Document current string literal usage patterns

## Success Criteria

âœ… **All 17+ tool systems have comprehensive test coverage**
âœ… **Performance baselines established for every tool**
âœ… **Complete inventory of all tools and their capabilities**
âœ… **Cross-system interaction failures documented**
âœ… **String literal usage mapped across all systems**
âœ… **Fallback executor patterns documented**
âœ… **Test infrastructure ready for migration validation**

## Expected Outcomes

After Phase 0 completion:
1. **Regression Prevention** - Any functionality loss during migration will be immediately detected
2. **Performance Monitoring** - We'll know if the unified foundation impacts performance
3. **Complete Documentation** - Full understanding of what each system provides
4. **Risk Mitigation** - High-risk areas identified before migration begins
5. **Validation Framework** - Infrastructure to validate each migration step

## Timeline

**Phase 0 Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- Week 1: System-specific functional tests
- Week 2: Cross-system and performance tests  
- Week 3: Documentation, analysis, and infrastructure completion

This baseline validation is critical for the success of the unified tools foundation project. It ensures we maintain all existing functionality while improving the architecture.

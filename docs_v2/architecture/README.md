# Architecture Documentation

## 📋 Overview
System architecture, design patterns, and core implementation principles for the cw-agent-swarm platform.

## 📁 What's in This Folder

### 🎯 **Master Reference**
- [`core-principles.md`](./core-principles.md) - **START HERE**: Master implementation guidelines and principles *(Coming soon)*

### 🏗️ **System Design**
- [`patterns/`](./patterns/) - Core design patterns and architectural patterns
- [`services/`](./services/) - Service layer architecture and communication patterns  
- [`database/`](./database/) - Database patterns, schemas, and data strategies
- [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) - System architecture diagrams and visual documentation

### 📚 **Migrated Content**
- [`memory/`](./memory/) - Memory system architecture (migrated from docs/architecture/memory/)
- [`system/`](./system/) - Core system architecture (migrated from docs/architecture/system/)

## 🎯 Quick Start Guides

### For Developers
1. **Always start** with [`core-principles.md`](./core-principles.md) for implementation guidelines *(Coming soon)*
2. Follow specific links to detailed patterns you need
3. Reference service-specific patterns in [`services/`](./services/)
4. Check database patterns in [`database/`](./database/) for data work

### For Architects
1. Review [`core-principles.md`](./core-principles.md) for architectural foundation *(Coming soon)*
2. Examine [`patterns/`](./patterns/) for design pattern documentation
3. Study [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) for system visualization
4. Reference [`services/`](./services/) for service architecture

### For System Understanding
1. Read [`memory/`](./memory/) for memory system architecture
2. Review [`system/`](./system/) for core system components
3. Check [`database/`](./database/) for data architecture patterns

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
- What are the core architectural principles?
- How should services be structured and communicate?
- What are the standard design patterns?
- How is error handling standardized?
- What are the database patterns and strategies?
- How is the memory system architected?

## 🔗 Related Documentation
- [`../standards/`](../standards/) - Code quality standards and patterns
- [`../systems/`](../systems/) - Individual system implementations
- [`../knowledge-base/decisions/`](../knowledge-base/decisions/) - Architecture Decision Records

## 📊 Implementation Status
- ✅ **Architecture Content Migrated** - Content from docs/architecture/ copied
- ⏳ **Core Principles Migration** - In Progress (will replace IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md)
- 📋 **Design Patterns Documentation** - Planned
- 📋 **Service Architecture Documentation** - Planned
- 📋 **Database Patterns Documentation** - Planned

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Phase 1**
1. **Create core-principles.md** - Master reference file to replace IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md
2. **Organize patterns/** - Extract design patterns from current guidelines
3. **Document services/** - Service layer architecture and communication
4. **Document database/** - Database patterns and dual-ID strategy

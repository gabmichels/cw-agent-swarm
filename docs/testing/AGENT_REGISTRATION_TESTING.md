## Testing Environment

The tests should be performed in the following environments:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development setup
   - Use mock data services

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Isolated from production
   - With real data services

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

- Clean test database
- Access to the registration form UI
- Access to the agent API endpoints
- Original Chloe agent for comparison

### Test Steps Template

1. Navigate to the agent registration form
2. Perform the specified test operation
3. Validate the expected outcome
4. Record any deviations from expected behavior
5. Capture screenshots for UI validation

## Success Criteria

The testing phase will be considered successful when:

1. All test cases pass with expected outcomes
2. Chloe can be fully recreated with identical functionality
3. New agents can be created with custom configurations
4. Agent-specific data is properly stored and retrieved
5. All UI components function correctly and provide appropriate feedback

## Known Limitations

- The current implementation does not include department selection options
- Agent relationships configuration is planned for a future phase

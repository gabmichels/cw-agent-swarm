### Sample Implementation for Strategy & Prioritization Tests

```typescript
async function testStrategyGeneration() {
  const agent = createTestAgent({
    enableMemoryManager: true,
    enableReflectionManager: true
  });
  
  await agent.initialize();
  
  // Request strategy generation for a domain
  const response = await agent.processUserInput(
    "Help me develop a strategy for researching AI safety publications. I want to stay updated on the latest developments."
  );
  
  // Verify strategy was generated
  expect(response.content).toContain("strategy");
  expect(response.content).toContain("research");
  expect(response.content).toContain("AI safety");
  
  // Check if strategy was stored in memory
  const memoryManager = agent.getManager(ManagerType.MEMORY);
  const strategyMemories = await memoryManager.searchMemories("AI safety strategy", {
    metadata: { type: "strategy" }
  });
  
  // Assert strategy was stored
  expect(strategyMemories.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  
  return strategyMemories[0];
}

async function testStrategyUpdating() {
  const agent = createTestAgent({
    enableMemoryManager: true,
    enableReflectionManager: true
  });
  
  await agent.initialize();
  
  // Create initial strategy
  await agent.processUserInput(
    "Help me develop a strategy for researching quantum computing papers. I want to focus on practical applications."
  );
  
  // Provide feedback on strategy to trigger update
  await agent.processUserInput(
    "That strategy worked well for finding applied research, but I'm missing theoretical breakthroughs. Can you update the strategy?"
  );
  
  // Verify strategy was updated
  const memoryManager = agent.getManager(ManagerType.MEMORY);
  const updatedStrategies = await memoryManager.searchMemories("quantum computing strategy update", {
    metadata: { type: "strategy_update" }
  });
  
  // Assert strategy update exists
  expect(updatedStrategies.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  
  // Verify update contains both practical and theoretical aspects
  const update = updatedStrategies[0].content;
  expect(update).toContain("practical");
  expect(update).toContain("theoretical");
  
  return update;
}

async function testBehaviorModifierGeneration() {
  const agent = createTestAgent({
    enableMemoryManager: true,
    enableReflectionManager: true
  });
  
  await agent.initialize();
  
  // Create a scenario requiring behavior modification
  await agent.processUserInput(
    "I notice you tend to provide very detailed responses. For our work together, I need more concise answers focused only on actionable steps."
  );
  
  // Allow time for reflection
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
  
  // Verify behavior modifier was created
  const reflectionManager = agent.getManager(ManagerType.REFLECTION);
  
  // This might need adjustment based on actual API
  const behaviorModifiers = await reflectionManager.getBehaviorModifiers();
  
  // Assert behavior modifiers exist
  expect(behaviorModifiers.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  
  // Verify modifiers contain conciseness directive
  const conciseModifier = behaviorModifiers.find(m => 
    m.description.toLowerCase().includes("concise") || 
    m.description.toLowerCase().includes("brief")
  );
  
  expect(conciseModifier).toBeDefined();
  
  return behaviorModifiers;
}
```

// Execute all tests
runAutonomyTests().catch(err => {
  console.error("Test suite failed:", err);
});
```

## Known Issues and Verification Points

Based on our autonomy audit and code review, we should pay special attention to:

1. **Self-scheduling functionality** - Currently not fully implemented; the `schedulePeriodicReflection` method exists in DefaultAgent but delegates to the ReflectionManager, which might not implement this method in all versions
   
2. **Connection between components** - Memory, planning, and scheduling exist but their integration for autonomous operation needs verification; specifically, the scheduling timer for executing scheduled tasks may not be running automatically

3. **Tool routing integration** - The DefaultAgent can execute tools but adaptive tool selection based on performance metrics might not be fully implemented

4. **Long-running task handling** - Tasks may be created but automatic execution of pending tasks might not be fully operational

5. **Complex task decomposition** - While the `planAndExecute` method exists, detailed step-by-step execution and tracking might be limited

## Implementation Challenges

The current test implementation faces several challenges:

1. **External API dependencies** - Many agent capabilities depend on external APIs requiring keys/credentials
2. **Complex dependency chains** - DefaultAgent has deep integration with other components that are difficult to mock
3. **Environment configuration** - Setting up a proper test environment requires configuring multiple services
4. **Type interfaces** - Some interfaces may not be fully documented or may change during development

## Test Environment Setup

To run these tests properly, ensure:

1. The agent has access to required external APIs (Twitter, market data, etc.)
2. Appropriate credentials are configured for notification services
3. Sufficient memory and processing resources are available for long-running tests
4. Log verbosity is increased to capture detailed execution information
5. Network connectivity is stable for external API calls

## Expected Outcomes

A fully autonomous agent should:

1. Successfully execute tasks without human intervention
2. Properly schedule and execute tasks at specified times
3. Break down complex tasks into logical subtasks
4. Handle errors gracefully and attempt recovery
5. Report completion and results through appropriate channels
6. Maintain state and continue operations across sessions
7. Efficiently utilize available tools based on task requirements

By executing these tests systematically, we can identify gaps in the agent's autonomy capabilities and target our development efforts accordingly.

## Implementation Gap Summary

Based on our code review, these are the key gaps in the current implementation:

1. **Autonomous Execution Engine** - There doesn't appear to be a background process that automatically checks for and executes scheduled tasks
   
2. **Self-Initiation** - The agent doesn't automatically create tasks based on memory contents or past user requests
   
3. **Tool Analytics** - While the interface defines metrics methods, the implementation of adaptive tool selection might be limited
   
4. **Persistence** - Task persistence between sessions depends on external storage that might not be configured by default
   
5. **Causal Analysis** - The detailed tracking of action-outcome relationships for learning might not be fully implemented

These gaps provide clear targets for future development to enhance the agent's autonomy.

6. **Test environment improvements** - Added support for loading environment variables from both .env and test.env files, allowing tests to run in different environments.

7. **Graceful test degradation** - Implemented tests that can still provide meaningful results even when certain capabilities (like API keys) are not available.

These test implementations provide comprehensive coverage of key autonomy capabilities identified in our audit, particularly focusing on:

- Tool integration and adaptation
- Strategy development and improvement
- Reflection and learning from experience
- Time-aware task planning and optimization
- Handling incomplete information

## Current Focus

The current focus should be on implementing Phase 5 (End-to-End) tests while ensuring the existing tests remain stable and reliable. This involves:

1. Creating comprehensive end-to-end scenarios that exercise multiple components
2. Implementing tests for memory-tool integration
3. Testing rate limiting and API throttling behavior
4. Implementing tests for cross-tool data sharing
5. Testing adaptive tool selection based on past performance

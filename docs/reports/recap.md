# Cognitive Memory System Implementation Recap

## 1. Episodic Memory
- ✅ Implemented structured event sequences with `EpisodicMemory` interface
- ✅ Added temporal relationships with `sequence` and `episodeId` properties
- ✅ Created `addEpisodicMemory` method for storing events with context

## 2. Memory Consolidation
- ✅ Implemented `consolidateMemories` method for strengthening important memories
- ✅ Added decay factor calculation based on importance and usage
- ✅ Created scheduled task that runs daily to consolidate memory
- ✅ Implemented mechanism for transferring short-term to long-term with importance tracking

## 3. Forgetting Mechanisms
- ✅ Added memory decay based on importance, usage, and time
- ✅ Implemented pruning for low-importance memories
- ✅ Created importance-based decay factors that remove irrelevant information

## 4. Knowledge Graph
- ✅ Implemented full `KnowledgeGraph` class with nodes and edges
- ✅ Added relationship types for different semantic connections
- ✅ Created inference engine for discovering new connections
- ✅ Built path-finding algorithm to traverse related concepts
- ✅ Added automatic strengthening of connections based on usage

## 5. Emotional Context
- ✅ Added emotion detection with `detectEmotions` method
- ✅ Implemented storage of emotional context with memories
- ✅ Created `getMemoriesByEmotion` for emotion-based retrieval
- ✅ Added emotion-based importance adjustment

## 6. Working Memory Limitations
- ✅ Implemented Miller's Law (7±2 items) capacity constraint
- ✅ Added priority-based eviction for less important items
- ✅ Created `addToWorkingMemory` with capacity management
- ✅ Exposed `getWorkingMemory` for current thought access

## 7. Memory Reconsolidation
- ✅ Implemented `reconsolidateMemory` for updating existing memories
- ✅ Added importance recalculation based on new information
- ✅ Created framework for handling contradictory information

## Integration with Agent
- ✅ Updated `ChloeAgent` class to use new cognitive systems
- ✅ Added memory consolidation scheduled task
- ✅ Created cognitive tools for use with the intent router
- ✅ Provided comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements
1. **Procedural Memory**: Add specialized storage for learned skills and procedures
2. **Prospective Memory**: Implement "remember to remember" functionality
3. **Autobiographical Timeline**: Create coherent life narrative
4. **Advanced Inference**: Improve the knowledge graph with deeper causal understanding
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Enhance emotion detection with ML-based models

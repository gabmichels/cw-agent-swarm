# Documentation Reorganization

This document explains the reorganization of the documentation directory performed on June 5, 2023.

## Reorganization Summary

The documentation has been organized into a structured hierarchy to improve findability and maintainability:

```
docs/
├── README.md                        # Main documentation guide
├── architecture/                    # System architecture documentation
│   ├── memory/                      # Memory system design
│   └── system/                      # Core system architecture
├── code-standards/                  # Coding guidelines and standards
├── memory/                          # Memory system documentation
│   ├── api/                         # API documentation and patterns
│   ├── architecture/                # Memory system architecture
│   ├── implementation/              # Implementation guides and tracking
│   ├── integration/                 # Integration documentation
│   ├── performance/                 # Performance documentation
│   └── testing/                     # Testing documentation
├── project-planning/                # Project planning documents
├── refactoring/                     # Refactoring project documentation
│   └── metadata/                    # Metadata refactoring project
│       ├── test-results/            # Test execution results
│       └── ...                      # Various metadata documentation
└── reports/                         # Status reports and summaries
```

## Changes Made

1. Created a structured directory hierarchy for different types of documentation
2. Moved metadata refactoring files from the root directory to `docs/refactoring/metadata/`
3. Organized architectural documentation in `docs/architecture/`
4. Consolidated coding standards in `docs/code-standards/`
5. Placed project planning documents in `docs/project-planning/`
6. Created a central README.md file for the docs directory
7. Renamed potentially conflicting files to have more specific names
8. Removed duplicate documents
9. Added category-specific README.md files for subdirectories
10. Organized memory documentation into logical categories (api, architecture, implementation, integration, performance, testing)

## Benefits

- **Improved Navigation**: Logical grouping makes it easier to find relevant documentation
- **Better Organization**: Related documents are grouped together
- **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory is cleaner with documentation properly organized
- **Clear Structure**: Documentation hierarchy reflects the project's architecture
- **Maintainability**: Easier to add new documentation in the appropriate location

## Documentation Categories

1. **Architecture**: System design, components, and architectural decisions
2. **Code Standards**: Coding guidelines, typing requirements, and best practices
3. **Memory**: Memory system documentation, organized by functional area
4. **Project Planning**: Project roadmaps, MCP documentation, and cleanup plans
5. **Refactoring**: Documentation for major refactoring projects
6. **Reports**: Status reports and project summaries

## Memory Documentation Organization

The memory documentation has been further organized into these subcategories:

1. **API**: Documentation of memory APIs, patterns, and issues
2. **Architecture**: Memory system design, data structures, and access patterns
3. **Implementation**: Implementation guides, tracking, and next steps
4. **Integration**: Integration with UI components and deployment information
5. **Performance**: Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
6. **Testing**: Test plans, results, and integration testing information

Each subcategory has its own README.md file that explains the contents and provides navigation guidance.

## Future Documentation Guidelines

When adding new documentation:

1. Place files in the appropriate category folder
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Link related documents to each other
5. Update the main README.md if adding a significant new category
6. Consider creating a category-specific README.md for substantial additions

# Memory System Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the implementation progress of the memory system standardization project across all phases.

## Phase 1: Audit and Documentation ✅

- [x] Document current memory architecture in `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] Document memory schemas in `MEMORY_SCHEMAS.md`
- [x] Document memory operations in `MEMORY_OPERATIONS.md`
- [x] Document entity relationships in `MEMORY_ERD.md`
- [x] Document access patterns in `ACCESS_PATTERNS.md`
- [x] Create proposed solution in `PROPOSED_SOLUTION.md`
- [x] Create README with navigation guide

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]

**Deliverables**:
- Complete documentation of current system
- Detailed plan for standardization
- Identified issues and inconsistencies
- Clear path for incremental implementation

## Phase 2: Core Refactoring ✅

### Configuration and Types

- [x] Create `/server/memory/config` directory
- [x] Implement standardized `CollectionConfig` interface
- [x] Define consistent `MemoryType` enum
- [x] Create standardized constants file
- [x] Define error types and codes

### Schema Definitions

- [x] Create `/server/memory/models` directory
- [x] Implement `BaseMemorySchema` interface
- [x] Define collection-specific schemas:
  - [x] `MessageSchema`
  - [x] `ThoughtSchema`
  - [x] `DocumentSchema`
  - [x] `TaskSchema`
  - [x] `MemoryEditSchema`
- [x] Implement schema validation utilities

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]

**Deliverables**:
- Core directory structure established
- Standardized type definitions across all memory operations
- Well-defined schema interfaces for all memory types
- Validation utilities for type safety
- Error handling standardization

## Phase 3: Service Layer ✅

### Core Memory Service

- [x] Create `/server/memory/services/memory` directory
- [x] Implement `MemoryService` class
- [x] Implement core operations:
  - [x] `addMemory`
  - [x] `getMemory`
  - [x] `updateMemory`
  - [x] `deleteMemory`

### Search Service

- [x] Create `/server/memory/services/search` directory
- [x] Implement `SearchService` class
- [x] Implement semantic search operations
- [x] Add hybrid search (vector + tag)
- [x] Implement filter building

### Specialized Services

- [x] Create importance management service (within memory service)
- [x] Implement causal relationship service (within memory service)
- [x] Add version history tracking service (within memory service)
- [x] Create embedding generation service

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive service layer implementation
- Standardized memory operations
- Flexible search capabilities
- Embedding generation service integration
- Error handling and validation

## Phase 4: Testing Framework ⏵

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Create `/server/memory/testing` directory
- [ ] Add tests for client operations
- [ ] Add tests for service operations
- [ ] Test schema validation

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Test client-database interaction
- [ ] Test service-client interaction
- [ ] Implement test data generation

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Add benchmarking utilities
- [ ] Test search performance
- [ ] Test bulk operations

## Phase 5: Finalization ⏵

### Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and patterns
- [ ] Create deployment guide

### Deployment

- [ ] Create initial database setup script
- [ ] Implement collection creation and verification
- [ ] Create health check utilities

### Cleanup

- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Refactor any remaining technical debt
- [ ] Finalize documentation

**Note**: Phase 5 has been simplified since we're starting from scratch with the data and don't need migration or backward compatibility.

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Complete ✅

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 4 by creating testing directory and utilities
2. Implement unit tests for the memory and search services
3. Create integration test suite for client-database interaction

**Recent Changes**:
- Completed service layer implementation
- Implemented memory service with CRUD operations
- Created search service with hybrid search capabilities
- Integrated embedding service for vector generation
- Added comprehensive validation and error handling
- Updated Phase 5 to reflect that we're starting from scratch with no need for migration

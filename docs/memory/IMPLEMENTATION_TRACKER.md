## Phase 5: Finalization ⏵

### Documentation

- [x] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [x] Add usage examples and patterns
- [x] Create React hooks usage examples
- [ ] Create deployment guide (In Progress)

### Deployment

- [x] Create initial database setup script
- [x] Implement collection creation and verification scripts
- [x] Create health check utilities

### UI Integration

- [x] Create detailed UI Integration Plan
- [x] Create React hooks for memory operations
- [x] Create basic API routes for memory operations
- [ ] Update memory tab UI components to use new memory services (In Progress)
- [ ] Refactor chat history to use standardized memory system
- [ ] Update Knowledge Management components (KnowledgeTab, FlaggedItemsList)
- [ ] Refactor KnowledgeGraph to use memory service for knowledge relationships
- [ ] Update file management components (FilesTable) to use document memories
- [ ] Modify Tools & Diagnostics components (ToolsTab) to use memory service
- [ ] Implement memory visualization and management UI improvements
- [ ] Update memory search functionality with new hybrid search capabilities

### Cleanup

- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Refactor any remaining technical debt
- [ ] Finalize documentation

**Note**: Phase 5 has been simplified since we're starting from scratch with the data and don't need migration or backward compatibility.

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 5 - In Progress ⏵

**Next Steps**:
1. Continue UI integration with Memory Tab components
2. Start refactoring chat history to use the standardized memory system
3. Update knowledge management components
4. Implement memory visualization and relationship features
5. Complete the deployment guide

**Recent Changes**:
- Fixed constructor parameter issues in multiple API routes:
  - Corrected MemoryService constructor calls to use proper parameters
  - Fixed SearchService constructor calls with correct parameter order
  - Updated search and searchMemories method calls with proper parameters
  - Added proper error handling with MemoryErrorCode throughout API routes
- Enhanced the hybrid-search API endpoint to use the correct hybridSearch method
- Created a dedicated test script for hybrid search functionality
- Added input validation in API routes to prevent errors with missing parameters
- Standardized error response formats across all memory API routes
- Added proper JSDoc documentation to all API route handlers
- Added type parameters to essential method calls
- Created health check API route for monitoring the memory system status
- Fixed other API route issues:
  - Removed unused imports
  - Ensured proper method signatures in all API routes
- Implemented memory service initialization utility for API routes
- Completed all core API routes for memory operations:
  - GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/memory/[id] for individual memory operations
  - GET/POST /api/memory for listing and creating memories
  - POST /api/memory/search for vector search
  - POST /api/memory/hybrid-search for hybrid search
  - GET /api/memory/history/[id] for memory version history
  - GET /api/memory/health for system status monitoring
- Updated package.json with useful scripts for memory system management:
  - memory:setup-collections - Initialize required collections
  - memory:health-check - Verify system status
  - memory:api-test - Test all memory endpoints
  - memory:test-hybrid-search - Test hybrid search functionality

**Current Focus**: Cleaning up API routes and ensuring proper parameter usage in all memory API endpoints. Next will be updating UI components to use these standardized API routes.

- [x] Implement memory visualization and management UI improvements
- [x] Update memory search functionality with new hybrid search capabilities

### Cleanup

- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Refactor any remaining technical debt
- [ ] Finalize documentation

**Note**: Phase 5 has been simplified since we're starting from scratch with the data and don't need migration or backward compatibility.

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on UI component integration for Phase 5:

1. **Completed**:
   - API routes implementation
   - Memory service integration
   - MemoryTab and MemoryItem components update
   - Fixed type issues in MemoryTab.tsx (enum/string comparisons)
   - Hybrid search implementation
   - Created React hooks for memory operations (useMemory.ts)
   - Created specialized hooks for chat memory (useChatMemory.ts) 
   - Updated ChatInterface.tsx to use standardized memory APIs
   - Updated ChatMessages.tsx for memory integration
   - Created useMemoryGraph hook for relationship visualization
   - Implemented MemoryGraphVisualization component
   - Created KnowledgeGraphPage with search and filtering

2. **In Progress**:
   - Integration testing for all UI components
   - Updating file management components

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Integration testing for all UI components
   - Performance optimization for memory operations
   - Removing deprecated code paths
   - Updating file management components
   - Modifying Tools & Diagnostics components

## Timeline

## Challenges and Solutions

### Resolved Challenges

1. **Import Circular Dependencies**: Resolved by restructuring the exports and properly organizing module dependencies.
2. **Type Safety vs Runtime Flexibility**: Created a balance between strict typing during development and runtime flexibility through strategic type assertions.
3. **Framework Migration**: Successfully transitioned from Jest to Vitest for better integration with the codebase.
4. **API Parameter Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation to prevent errors in API routes.
5. **Memory Visualization Layout**: Implemented a simplified force-directed layout algorithm for the memory graph visualization.

### Current Challenges

1. **UI Component Migration**: Working through the various UI components that need to be updated to use the new memory system.
2. **Legacy Code Compatibility**: Ensuring backward compatibility with existing components while integrating the new system.
3. **Proper Payload Access**: Converting components to use the new payload structure correctly.

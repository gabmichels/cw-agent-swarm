# Memory System Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the progress of the memory system standardization project. It provides a clear overview of what has been implemented and what remains to be done.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Architecture (Completed âœ…)
- [x] Requirements gathering
- [x] Architecture design
- [x] Schema planning
- [x] API interface design

### Phase 2: Core Types and Schemas (Completed âœ…)
- [x] Define memory types and enums
- [x] Create basic schema interfaces
- [x] Define collection configurations
- [x] Implement validation utilities
- [x] Standardize error handling
- [x] Create utility functions

### Phase 3: Service Layer Implementation (Completed âœ…)
- [x] Implement memory service
- [x] Implement search service
- [x] Implement metadata service
- [x] Add transaction support
- [x] Implement memory store providers
- [x] Add memory retrieval optimizations
- [x] Implement vector storage integration

### Phase 4: Reactive State Management (Completed âœ…)
- [x] Implement query store
- [x] Create reactive hooks layer
- [x] Add memory subscription capabilities
- [x] Implement memory action dispatching
- [x] Add optimistic updates
- [x] Implement memory cache and invalidation

### Phase 5: UI Component Integration (In Progress ðŸš§)
- [x] Update ChatInterface.tsx to use memory system
- [x] Add memory IDs to message components 
- [x] Update knowledge system to use memory system
- [x] Implement flag/importance API in knowledge components
- [x] Add flagged messages display in KnowledgeTab
- [x] Create KnowledgeGraph visualization using memory relationships
- [x] Create memory visualization components
- [x] Update FilesTable component to support memory system
- [x] Update file upload API to use the standardized memory system
- [x] Create Files tab with integrated memory document support
- [x] Implement tools memory hook (useToolsMemory)
- [x] Modify Tools & Diagnostics components (ToolsTab) to use memory service
- [x] Update diagnostic components

The current implementation focus is on finalization and cleanup:

- [x] Added `useMemory.ts` - a base hook providing CRUD operations for memory items
- [x] Added `useChatMemory.ts` - a specialized hook for chat history management 
- [x] Added `useKnowledgeMemory.ts` - a hook for knowledge management with flagging and importance features
- [x] Added `useMemoryGraph.ts` - a hook for visualizing memory relationships
- [x] Added `MemoryGraphVisualization` component for visualizing memory data
- [x] Added `KnowledgeGraphPage` for exploring knowledge relationships
- [x] Enhanced `FilesTable` component to support both standard and memory-based file access
- [x] Updated file upload API to store documents in the standardized memory system
- [x] Added `useToolsMemory` hook for tools and diagnostics tracking
- [x] Created memory-based `MemoryToolsTab` component with tabs for tools and diagnostics
- [x] Added tool execution history with detailed display
- [x] Added diagnostic history with detailed display
- [x] Created API endpoints for tools and diagnostics with memory integration

### Cleanup
- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Final integration testing

## Scheduled Tasks

| Task | Assigned To | Status | Due Date |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Create memory service | Alice | Completed | May 10, 2024 |
| Implement hooks layer | Bob | Completed | May 20, 2024 |
| Update UI components | Charlie | Completed | June 15, 2024 |
| Testing & documentation | Team | In Progress | June 30, 2024 |

## Implementation Notes

- Memory ID structure follows the pattern: `{type}_{uuid}`
- All timestamps use ISO format
- Vector embeddings are stored separately from metadata
- Memory permissions are enforced at the service layer
- FilesTable component provides dual mode for backward compatibility
- ToolsTab component supports both legacy and memory-based operation through tabbed interface
- API endpoints for tools and diagnostics support memory system integration

## Current Issues

- Need to improve performance of large memory retrievals
- Consider adding bulk operations for memory items
- Memory cleanup jobs need to be scheduled

## Next Steps

1. Complete final integration testing
2. Implement optimization for memory subscriptions
3. Develop backup and restore functionality for memory collections
4. Deploy monitoring for memory system performance

Expected Phase 5 completion: June 30, 2024

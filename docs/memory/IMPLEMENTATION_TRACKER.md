# Memory System Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the implementation progress of the memory system standardization project across all phases.

## Phase 1: Audit and Documentation ✅

- [x] Document current memory architecture in `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Schema Definitions

- [x] Create `/server/memory/models` directory
- [x] Implement `BaseMemorySchema` interface
- [x] Define collection-specific schemas:
  - [x] `MessageSchema`
  - [x] `ThoughtSchema`

  - [x] `TaskSchema`
  - [x] `MemoryEditSchema`
- [x] Implement schema validation utilities

- [x] Implement `MemoryService` class
- [x] Implement core operations:
  - [x] `addMemory`
  - [x] `getMemory`
  - [x] `updateMemory`
  - [x] `deleteMemory`

### Search Service

- [x] Create `/server/memory/services/search` directory
- [x] Implement `SearchService` class
- [x] Implement semantic search operations
- [x] Add hybrid search (vector + tag)
- [x] Implement filter building

### Specialized Services

- [x] Create importance management service (within memory service)
- [x] Implement causal relationship service (within memory service)
- [x] Add version history tracking service (within memory service)
- [x] Create embedding generation service

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive service layer implementation
- Standardized memory operations
- Flexible search capabilities
- Embedding generation service integration
- Error handling and validation

## Phase 4: Testing Framework ✅

### Unit Tests

- [x] Create `/server/memory/testing` directory
- [x] Add tests for client operations
- [x] Add tests for service operations
- [x] Test schema validation

### Integration Tests

- [x] Create integration test suite
- [x] Test client-database interaction
- [x] Test service-client interaction
- [x] Implement test data generation

### Performance Tests

- [x] Add benchmarking utilities
- [x] Test search performance
- [x] Test bulk operations

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive test suite for all system components
- Test data generation utilities for consistent testing
- Integration tests for end-to-end verification
- Performance benchmarks for key operations
- Improved code quality and reliability

## Phase 5: Finalization ⏵

### Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and patterns
- [ ] Create deployment guide

### Deployment

- [ ] Create initial database setup script
- [ ] Implement collection creation and verification
- [ ] Create health check utilities

### UI Integration

- [ ] Update memory tab UI components to use new memory services
- [ ] Refactor chat history to use standardized memory system
- [ ] Update API routes to use the new memory and search services
- [ ] Update Knowledge Management components (KnowledgeTab, FlaggedItemsList)
- [ ] Refactor KnowledgeGraph to use memory service for knowledge relationships
- [ ] Update file management components (FilesTable) to use document memories
- [ ] Modify Tools & Diagnostics components (ToolsTab) to use memory service
- [ ] Implement memory visualization and management UI improvements
- [ ] Update memory search functionality with new hybrid search capabilities

### Cleanup

- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Refactor any remaining technical debt
- [ ] Finalize documentation

**Note**: Phase 5 has been simplified since we're starting from scratch with the data and don't need migration or backward compatibility.

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 5 - In Progress ⏵

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin UI integration to connect the new memory system with the Next.js frontend
2. Create comprehensive API documentation for all services
3. Implement collection creation and verification scripts
4. Remove deprecated code and complete final cleanup

**Recent Changes**:
- Completed testing framework implementation
- Created unit tests for memory and search services
- Implemented mock services for testing
- Added integration tests for system validation
- Created test data generators for consistent testing
- Converted Jest tests to Vitest across the codebase
- Fixed type issues in test implementations
- Added performance benchmarking for key operations

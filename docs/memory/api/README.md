# Memory System API Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the API aspects of the memory system, including API documentation, patterns, known issues, and guides.

## Contents

- [**API_DOCUMENTATION.md**](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md) - Provides comprehensive documentation of the memory system API, including endpoints, parameters, response formats, and examples.

- [**NEXT_JS_API_PATTERNS.md**](./NEXT_JS_API_PATTERNS.md) - Outlines best practices and patterns for implementing memory-related API routes in Next.js, including error handling, validation, and response formatting.

- [**NEXT_JS_API_ISSUES.md**](./NEXT_JS_API_ISSUES.md) - Documents known issues with memory system APIs in Next.js and their workarounds or solutions.

- [**TAG_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md**](./TAG_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md) - Provides guidance on implementing and using tag extraction functionality in the memory API.

## API Principles

The memory system API follows these key principles:

1. **RESTful Design** - APIs follow REST principles where appropriate
2. **Consistent Responses** - Response formats are consistent across endpoints
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Errors are properly captured and returned with helpful messages
4. **Input Validation** - All inputs are validated before processing
5. **Performance Optimization** - APIs are designed for optimal performance
6. **Security First** - Security considerations are prioritized in API design

## API Categories

The memory system provides the following categories of APIs:

1. **Memory Management** - APIs for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting memories
2. **Search** - APIs for semantic search and filtering of memories
3. **Tag Management** - APIs for working with memory tags
4. **Memory Analytics** - APIs for analyzing memory usage and patterns
5. **Memory Import/Export** - APIs for importing and exporting memories

## Contributing to the API

When working on memory system APIs:

1. Follow the patterns described in **NEXT_JS_API_PATTERNS.md**
2. Document all API changes in **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**
3. Ensure proper error handling and validation
4. Add tests for all API endpoints
5. Document any issues encountered in **NEXT_JS_API_ISSUES.md**
6. Consider security implications of API changes

# Memory System Cleanup Plan

This document outlines the plan for cleaning up the codebase as part of the memory system standardization project. The goal is to completely remove legacy code and fully implement the standardized memory system.

## Current Status - July 9, 2024

We have successfully:

1. **Complete Removal of Legacy Code** - All legacy memory system code has been removed, not just deprecated
2. **No Backward Compatibility** - Backward compatibility implementations have been completely eliminated
3. **Full Refactoring** - All methods and components have been refactored to use the standardized memory system directly

Our approach has been:
1. Identify all files still using the legacy system
2. Completely refactor these files to use the standardized system
3. Remove unused compatibility layers and adapters entirely
4. Fix all linter errors and type mismatches that resulted from these changes

## Identified Legacy Components

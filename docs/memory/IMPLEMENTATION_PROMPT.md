3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove any deprecated code and technical debt

## Key Interfaces

The primary interfaces to implement include:

```typescript
// Collection configuration
interface CollectionConfig<T> {
  name: string;
  schema: T;
  indices: string[];
  defaults: Partial<T>;
}

// Memory client for database operations
class MemoryClient {
  constructor(options: MemoryClientOptions);
  addPoint<T>(collection: string, point: MemoryPoint<T>): Promise<string>;
  searchPoints<T>(collection: string, query: SearchQuery): Promise<SearchResult<T>[]>;
  updatePoint<T>(collection: string, id: string, updates: Partial<MemoryPoint<T>>): Promise<boolean>;
  deletePoint(collection: string, id: string, options?: DeleteOptions): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Core memory service
class MemoryService {
  constructor(client: MemoryClient, embeddingService: EmbeddingService);
  addMemory<T>(params: AddMemoryParams<T>): Promise<MemoryResult>;
  getMemory<T>(params: GetMemoryParams): Promise<Memory<T> | null>;
  updateMemory<T>(params: UpdateMemoryParams<T>): Promise<boolean>;
  deleteMemory(params: DeleteMemoryParams): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

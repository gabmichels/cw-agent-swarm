# Memory System Implementation Prompt

## Overview

This document serves as a self-prompt to maintain context about the memory system standardization project. It provides essential information about the project structure, current status, and key considerations.

## Project Summary

The memory system standardization project aims to refactor the existing monolithic memory management code (~3300 lines) into a modular, testable, and type-safe architecture. The project addresses issues with inconsistent collection naming, type inconsistencies, poor error handling, and lack of testing.

## Documentation Reference

The project is guided by the following documentation:

1. `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall system architecture
2. `MEMORY_SCHEMAS.md` - Memory data structures and schemas
3. `MEMORY_OPERATIONS.md` - API documentation for operations
4. `MEMORY_ERD.md` - Entity relationships between memories
5. `ACCESS_PATTERNS.md` - How memory is accessed in the application
6. `PROPOSED_SOLUTION.md` - Detailed plan for standardization
7. `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` - Tracks implementation progress

## Current Status

Please refer to `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` for the current status. Update this file after each implementation session to track progress.

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing each phase:

### General Guidelines

1. **Incremental Approach**: Implement one component at a time with well-defined interfaces
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure new code can coexist with current code
3. **Testing**: Add tests for each component as it's implemented
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as implementation progresses
5. **Error Handling**: Use standardized error handling throughout

### Phase 2 Guidelines

1. **Directory Structure**: Create the module structure before implementation
2. **Type Safety**: Ensure strict typing for all interfaces
3. **Constants**: Define all constants in a centralized location
4. **Validation**: Implement schema validation from the start

### Phase 3 Guidelines

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep services focused on specific responsibilities
2. **Common Patterns**: Use consistent patterns across all services
3. **Interface First**: Define interfaces before implementation

### Phase 4 Guidelines

1. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage of critical paths
2. **Realistic Testing**: Create tests that reflect actual usage patterns
3. **Performance Testing**: Include performance benchmarks

### Phase 5 Guidelines

1. **Clean Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation
2. **Deployment Planning**: Design clean database setup and validation
3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove any deprecated code and technical debt

## Key Interfaces

The primary interfaces to implement include:

```typescript
// Collection configuration
interface CollectionConfig<T> {
  name: string;
  schema: T;
  indices: string[];
  defaults: Partial<T>;
}

// Memory client for database operations
class MemoryClient {
  constructor(options: MemoryClientOptions);
  addPoint<T>(collection: string, point: MemoryPoint<T>): Promise<string>;
  searchPoints<T>(collection: string, query: SearchQuery): Promise<SearchResult<T>[]>;
  updatePoint<T>(collection: string, id: string, updates: Partial<MemoryPoint<T>>): Promise<boolean>;
  deletePoint(collection: string, id: string, options?: DeleteOptions): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Core memory service
class MemoryService {
  constructor(client: MemoryClient, embeddingService: EmbeddingService);
  addMemory<T>(params: AddMemoryParams<T>): Promise<MemoryResult>;
  getMemory<T>(params: GetMemoryParams): Promise<Memory<T> | null>;
  updateMemory<T>(params: UpdateMemoryParams<T>): Promise<boolean>;
  deleteMemory(params: DeleteMemoryParams): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### Implementation Notes

##### Type Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility while migrating to the standardized system, the UI components use flexible property access paths that check multiple possible locations for data:

```typescript
// Example of robust property access with fallbacks
const memoryType = memory.payload?.type || 
                  memory.kind || 
                  memory.metadata?.type || 
                  memory.payload?.metadata?.category || 
                  'unknown';
```

##### Search Enhancement

The hybrid search implementation provides significantly improved results by combining vector similarity with text matching:

```typescript
// Example hybrid search API call
fetch('/api/memory/hybrid-search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "user query",
    filter: {
      must: [
        {
          key: 'type',
          match: {
            in: selectedTypes
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    hybridRatio: 0.7 // 70% vector, 30% text
  })
})
```

##### Version History

The memory version history feature now works with the standardized memory_edit schema, making it easier to track and display memory changes over time.

## Next Steps

1. Continue UI integration by updating the memory tab components
2. Complete any remaining API route improvements
3. Update chat interface components to use the standardized memory system
4. Enhance knowledge management components
5. Implement memory visualization and relationship features

### Current Focus

We are currently focusing on ensuring all API routes are fully functional and properly implemented before proceeding with the UI integration work. The API routes now handle errors correctly, validate input parameters, and communicate with the memory services using the correct parameter formats.

After completing the API route cleanup, we will continue with the Memory Tab component updates as they provide the most direct interface to the memory system.

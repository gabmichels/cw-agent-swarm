# Memory System Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the overall architecture of the memory system, including data structures, operations, entity relationships, and access patterns.

## Contents

- [**MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md**](./MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Provides a high-level overview of the memory system architecture, including the core components and their interactions.

- [**MEMORY_SCHEMAS.md**](./MEMORY_SCHEMAS.md) - Documents the data structures used throughout the memory system, including schemas for different memory types.

- [**MEMORY_OPERATIONS.md**](./MEMORY_OPERATIONS.md) - Details the supported operations for interacting with the memory system, including both read and write operations.

- [**MEMORY_ERD.md**](./MEMORY_ERD.md) - Contains entity relationship diagrams and detailed explanations of how different memory entities relate to each other.

- [**ACCESS_PATTERNS.md**](./ACCESS_PATTERNS.md) - Describes the common patterns for accessing memory throughout the application, including examples of typical queries.

- [**PROPOSED_SOLUTION.md**](./PROPOSED_SOLUTION.md) - Outlines the plan for standardizing and improving the memory system architecture.

## Key Architectural Principles

The memory system architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Modular Design** - Components are separated by concern, with clear interfaces between them
2. **Type Safety** - Strong typing is used throughout to prevent runtime errors
3. **Consistent Interfaces** - Operations follow consistent parameter and return patterns
4. **Flexible Storage** - Vector database (Qdrant) enables semantic search and flexible schemas
5. **Scalable Design** - Architecture supports growing memory needs and complex query patterns

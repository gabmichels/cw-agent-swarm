# Memory System Testing Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to testing the memory system, including test plans, test results, and guides for running tests.

## Contents

- [**TESTING.md**](./TESTING.md) - Provides an overview of the testing strategy and guidelines for the memory system. This document outlines the different types of tests and their purpose.

- [**TESTING_RESULTS.md**](./TESTING_RESULTS.md) - Contains results from testing sessions, including test coverage, test outcomes, and identified issues.

- [**RUNNING_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md**](./RUNNING_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md) - Provides detailed instructions for running integration tests for the memory system.

- [**INTEGRATION_TESTING_SUMMARY.md**](./INTEGRATION_TESTING_SUMMARY.md) - Summarizes the results of integration testing, including key findings and areas that need improvement.

- [**INTEGRATION_TEST_ISSUES.md**](./INTEGRATION_TEST_ISSUES.md) - Documents specific issues found during integration testing, including steps to reproduce and potential solutions.

- [**TOOL_ROUTING_TEST_PLAN.md**](./TOOL_ROUTING_TEST_PLAN.md) - Contains a test plan specifically focused on tool routing functionality within the memory system.

## Testing Approach

The memory system testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Testing** - Tests for individual functions and components
2. **Integration Testing** - Tests for interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Testing** - Tests for complete workflows from user perspective
4. **Performance Testing** - Tests for system performance under various conditions
5. **Regression Testing** - Tests to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

## Test Coverage Goals

The memory system aims for the following test coverage:

- **Core Logic**: 90%+ coverage
- **Service Layer**: 80%+ coverage
- **API Routes**: 70%+ coverage
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive testing of error conditions and boundary cases

## How to Use This Documentation

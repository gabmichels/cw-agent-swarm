# Tool Routing & Adaptation Integration Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the integration between the Tool Routing & Adaptation system and the standardized memory system.

## Background

During the memory system standardization project, we identified a potential disconnection in how tool usage metrics are stored and retrieved through the new memory services. This could affect the tool routing system's ability to learn from past tool executions and optimize future tool selections.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify that tool performance metrics are correctly stored in the memory system
2. Confirm that historical tool usage patterns are properly retrieved for decision-making
3. Validate that tool failure rates influence future tool selection
4. Ensure that tool adaptation works correctly with the new memory architecture
5. Test the end-to-end flow from tool execution to metrics storage to future tool selection

## Test Environment

- **Test Database**: Local Qdrant instance with standardized memory collections
- **Test API Keys**: Use test OpenAI API key with rate limiting disabled
- **Test Framework**: Vitest with extended timeout (15s)
- **Mock Services**: Create mock tool implementations for predictable behavior

## Test Cases

### 1. Tool Metrics Storage

#### 1.1 Basic Tool Execution Metrics Storage

**Objective**: Verify that basic tool execution metrics are stored correctly in the memory system.

**Steps**:
1. Execute a tool with known input parameters
2. Verify that execution time, result status, and basic metadata are stored
3. Check that the memory item is stored with correct type and relationships

**Expected Results**:
- Tool execution creates a memory entry with proper metadata
- Execution metrics are correctly formatted and stored
- Memory item has the expected relationships (execution â†’ task)

#### 1.2 Tool Error Handling Metrics

**Objective**: Confirm that tool errors are properly captured and stored.

**Steps**:
1. Execute a tool that will trigger a controlled error
2. Verify that error details are captured in the memory system
3. Check that error categorization is correct

**Expected Results**:
- Error details are stored in the tool execution memory
- Error type is correctly categorized
- Failure is properly linked to the tool execution

#### 1.3 Complex Tool Execution Chain

**Objective**: Test storage of metrics for tools that trigger multiple sub-tools.

**Steps**:
1. Execute a parent tool that triggers multiple child tools
2. Verify that each tool execution is captured
3. Check that the relationship between parent and child executions is maintained

**Expected Results**:
- Each tool execution has its own memory entry
- Parent-child relationships are correctly established
- Execution chain can be traversed through relationships

### 2. Tool Metrics Retrieval

#### 2.1 Historical Tool Performance Retrieval

**Objective**: Verify that historical tool performance data can be correctly retrieved.

**Steps**:
1. Store predefined tool execution data with varying performance metrics
2. Request historical performance for a specific tool
3. Verify that returned data accurately reflects stored metrics

**Expected Results**:
- Correct performance metrics are retrieved
- Data is properly aggregated and formatted
- Query filters work correctly for tool-specific data

#### 2.2 Tool Failure Pattern Analysis

**Objective**: Test the system's ability to analyze patterns in tool failures.

**Steps**:
1. Store multiple tool executions with specific failure patterns
2. Trigger failure pattern analysis
3. Check that patterns are correctly identified

**Expected Results**:
- Failure patterns are detected from memory data
- Pattern categorization is accurate
- Temporal aspects of failures are considered

#### 2.3 Cross-Tool Performance Comparison

**Objective**: Verify that the system can compare performance across similar tools.

**Steps**:
1. Store execution data for multiple tools with similar functionality
2. Request comparative performance analysis
3. Check that relative performance metrics are accurate

**Expected Results**:
- Tools are correctly grouped by functionality
- Comparative metrics are accurate
- Strengths and weaknesses of each tool are identified

### 3. Adaptive Tool Selection

#### 3.1 Basic Adaptive Selection

**Objective**: Verify that tool selection adapts based on historical performance.

**Steps**:
1. Store historical data showing one tool outperforming another for a specific task
2. Request tool selection for that task type
3. Verify that the better-performing tool is selected

**Expected Results**:
- Higher-performing tool is selected
- Selection algorithm considers relevant metrics
- Decision includes confidence score

#### 3.2 Context-Aware Tool Selection

**Objective**: Test adaptation based on contextual factors.

**Steps**:
1. Store data showing different tool performance in different contexts
2. Request tool selection with specific context parameters
3. Verify that selected tool is optimal for the given context

**Expected Results**:
- Tool selection varies appropriately with context
- Contextual factors are weighted correctly
- Selection includes reasoning about the context

#### 3.3 Failure-Aware Fallback Selection

**Objective**: Verify that the system selects appropriate fallback tools after failures.

**Steps**:
1. Store data showing consistent failures for a primary tool
2. Request tool selection after simulating recent failures
3. Check that an alternative tool is selected

**Expected Results**:
- System avoids recently failed tools
- Fallback selection is appropriate for the task
- Selection includes explanation of the fallback strategy

### 4. End-to-End Tool Adaptation

#### 4.1 Learning from Execution Outcomes

**Objective**: Verify that the system learns from execution outcomes over time.

**Steps**:
1. Execute a series of tools with varying outcomes
2. Observe tool selection changes over multiple iterations
3. Verify that selection improves based on observed outcomes

**Expected Results**:
- Tool selection improves with experience
- Learning rate is appropriate
- System adapts to changing performance patterns

#### 4.2 Memory-Based Tool Chain Optimization

**Objective**: Test optimization of multi-tool chains based on memory.

**Steps**:
1. Execute multi-tool chains multiple times with varying configurations
2. Request optimized tool chain configuration
3. Verify that the suggested chain maximizes overall performance

**Expected Results**:
- Optimized chain considers individual and joint tool performance
- Chain configuration recommendations are sound
- Optimization considers both success rate and efficiency

#### 4.3 Recovery from Poor Selection

**Objective**: Verify the system can recover from and learn from poor tool selections.

**Steps**:
1. Force selection of a suboptimal tool
2. Record the poor performance
3. Verify that subsequent selections avoid the poor-performing tool

**Expected Results**:
- System recognizes poor performance
- Subsequent selections avoid the problematic tool
- Recovery happens within a reasonable number of iterations

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create Test Fixtures**:
   - Implement mock tools with controllable performance characteristics
   - Create datasets of tool execution histories
   - Set up memory system with predefined tool metrics

2. **Develop Test Utilities**:
   - Functions to verify memory storage format
   - Utilities to compare expected vs. actual tool selections
   - Helpers to simulate tool execution with predefined outcomes

3. **Implement Test Suite**:
   - Create tests for each test case outlined above
   - Structure tests to run independently
   - Ensure proper cleanup after each test

4. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Include detailed logging for test verification
   - Add metrics collection during tests
   - Create visualizations of tool selection patterns

## Success Criteria

The integration testing will be considered successful when:

1. All test cases pass consistently
2. Tool performance metrics are correctly stored and retrieved
3. Tool selection adapts appropriately based on historical data
4. The system demonstrates learning from past tool executions
5. Recovery mechanisms work correctly after failures

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance**: Tests should include verification that tool performance data retrieval is efficient
- **Scaling**: Test with varying volumes of historical data to ensure scaling
- **Robustness**: Verify behavior with incomplete or corrupted tool metrics
- **Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing tool implementations

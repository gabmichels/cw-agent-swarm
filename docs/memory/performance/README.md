# Memory System Performance Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the performance aspects of the memory system, including benchmarks, optimization strategies, and performance testing.

## Contents

- [**PERF_BASELINE.md**](./PERF_BASELINE.md) - Documents the baseline performance measurements for the memory system, providing a reference point for comparing optimizations.

- [**PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md**](./PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md) - Outlines strategies and techniques for optimizing the performance of the memory system, including implemented optimizations and their results.

## Performance Considerations

The memory system's performance is critical for the overall user experience and is influenced by several factors:

1. **Database Performance** - Speed of vector database operations
2. **Query Optimization** - Efficiency of search queries
3. **Caching Strategy** - Appropriate use of caching to reduce database load
4. **Network Latency** - Minimizing data transfer between client and server
5. **UI Rendering** - Efficient rendering of memory-related components
6. **Background Processing** - Handling computationally intensive tasks in the background

## Performance Metrics

The memory system tracks the following key performance metrics:

- **Query Response Time** - Average and p95 times for memory queries
- **Memory Addition Latency** - Time to add new memories to the system
- **Search Performance** - Response time for semantic search operations
- **Memory Load Time** - Time to load memories in the UI
- **API Response Times** - Performance of memory-related API endpoints
- **Resource Utilization** - CPU, memory, and database resource usage

## Performance Goals

The memory system aims to achieve these performance targets:

- **Query Response**: < 200ms average, < 500ms p95
- **Memory Addition**: < 300ms average
- **Search Operations**: < 300ms average
- **UI Load Time**: < 1s for initial load, < 300ms for subsequent interactions
- **API Response**: < 500ms average

## How to Use This Documentation

- For understanding current performance baselines, refer to **PERF_BASELINE.md**
- For optimization strategies and results, see **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md**

## Contributing to Performance Improvements

When working on memory system performance:

1. Measure baseline performance before making changes
2. Document optimization strategies in **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md**
3. Quantify performance improvements with concrete metrics
4. Consider trade-offs between performance, code complexity, and resource usage
5. Update **PERF_BASELINE.md** when establishing new baselines

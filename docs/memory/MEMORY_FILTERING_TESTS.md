# Memory Filtering Test Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the unit tests developed for the memory filtering functionality implemented in the SearchService's `filter` method. These tests verify the correct behavior of filtering memories based on various criteria without performing semantic similarity searches.

## Test Structure

The tests utilize a mocked version of the SearchService with a fully controlled test environment to ensure deterministic results and avoid external dependencies like Qdrant. This approach allows for comprehensive testing of filtering logic in isolation.

## Test Suite Components

### Test Data Generation

Test data includes memory points of different types (messages, documents, thoughts) with various metadata attributes:
- Different memory types 
- Different tags
- Varying importance levels
- Different timestamps

### Mock Implementation

The mock implementation of the `filter` method:
- Creates a fixed set of test results
- Applies filtering based on the provided criteria
- Handles pagination through limit and offset
- Supports sorting operations

### Test Cases

1. **Filter by Tags**: Verifies that memories can be filtered by specific tags
   - Ensures only memories with the requested tags are returned
   - Confirms correct count of matching memories

2. **Filter by Type**: Tests filtering memories by type (MESSAGE, DOCUMENT, THOUGHT)
   - Ensures only memories of the specified type are returned
   - Verifies type-related properties on the results

3. **Filter by Metadata**: Tests filtering based on metadata properties
   - Filters memories with specific importance levels
   - Verifies matching IDs and metadata properties

4. **Sorting**: Tests correct sorting of results
   - Sorts memories by ID in ascending order
   - Verifies the sort order is maintained

5. **Pagination**: Tests correct pagination with limit and offset
   - Retrieves results in batches
   - Verifies different slices return the expected results

6. **Combined Filters**: Tests applying multiple filter criteria simultaneously
   - Combines importance and tag filters
   - Verifies results match all criteria

7. **Empty Results**: Tests handling of queries that return no results
   - Ensures empty arrays are returned properly
   - Verifies no errors occur with no matches

## Implementation Notes

1. The tests use Vitest's mocking capabilities to override the `filter` method implementation
2. Type assertions are used to handle TypeScript compatibility between mock data and actual types
3. The test structure follows established project patterns for memory service testing

## Relationship to API Endpoints

These tests support the following API endpoints:
- `/api/memory/filter` - Advanced filtering endpoint
- `/api/memory/bulk-tag` - Bulk tagging functionality

## Limitations

1. These are unit tests that don't verify integration with actual Qdrant database
2. Filter performance in large datasets is not tested
3. Some complex filter combinations could be added in future test expansions

## Running the Tests

```bash
npx vitest run src/server/memory/testing/unit/filter-service.test.ts
```

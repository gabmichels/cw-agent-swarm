## Current System Overview

The memory system is built on Qdrant, a vector database enabling semantic search. It stores various types of memories including messages, thoughts, documents, and tasks. The system supports operations like:

- Adding and retrieving memories
- Semantic search across memories
- Managing memory importance over time
- Tracking causal relationships between memories
- Maintaining version history of memories

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Collection Naming**: Mismatched singular/plural naming
2. **Monolithic Architecture**: ~3300 line file with mixed concerns
3. **Type Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent data structures
4. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error management
5. **No Testing**: Lack of tests for critical functionality
6. **Access Pattern Issues**: Inconsistent filter formats and query patterns

## Proposed Improvements

The documentation outlines a comprehensive plan to address these issues through:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Breaking down the monolith into focused modules
2. **Standardized Interfaces**: Consistent parameter and return types
3. **Strict Typing**: Type-safe operations with schema validation
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to errors
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests
6. **Incremental Migration**: Side-by-side implementation approach

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will proceed in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Audit and documentation (this folder) ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Core refactoring (standardized schemas and clients) ⏳
3. **Phase 3**: Service layer implementation ⏵
4. **Phase 4**: Testing framework ⏵
5. **Phase 5**: Migration of existing code ⏵

## Current Status

See the [Implementation Tracker](./implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md) for current progress.

## Contributing

When making changes to the memory system:

1. Update the relevant documentation in this folder
2. Follow the standardized interfaces defined in the proposed solution
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Maintain backward compatibility during migration
5. Update the implementation tracker with your progress

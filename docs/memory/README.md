# Memory System Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the memory system components.

## Components

### Schema Validation

The [Schema Validation](./SCHEMA_VALIDATION.md) system provides type-safe validation with versioning and migration capabilities. It ensures data integrity and provides a clear path for schema evolution.

### Memory Service Base Classes

The memory service base classes provide standardized, type-safe interfaces and implementations for memory operations. They follow a repository pattern with clear separation between data access and business logic.

Key features:
- Type-safe repositories and services with generic type parameters
- Schema validation integration for all operations
- Standardized error handling with detailed context
- Clean abstractions for vector database operations
- Support for advanced search and filtering

See the [Memory Service Base Classes README](../src/server/memory/services/base/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Collections

The memory system organizes data into specialized collections:

- **Chat Memory** - Stores conversation history with metadata
- **Knowledge Memory** - Stores extracted knowledge with context information
- **Cognitive Process Memory** - Stores thinking processes, reflections, and insights
- **Document Memory** - Stores document content and metadata
- **Task Memory** - Stores task information and status

## Architecture

The memory system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Services** - Business logic and error handling
2. **Repositories** - Data access and mapping
3. **Database Clients** - Direct database interaction
4. **Schemas** - Data validation and versioning

## Usage

See individual component documentation for usage examples.

## Current System Overview

The memory system is built on Qdrant, a vector database enabling semantic search. It stores various types of memories including messages, thoughts, documents, and tasks. The system supports operations like:

- Adding and retrieving memories
- Semantic search across memories
- Managing memory importance over time
- Tracking causal relationships between memories
- Maintaining version history of memories

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Collection Naming**: Mismatched singular/plural naming
2. **Monolithic Architecture**: ~3300 line file with mixed concerns
3. **Type Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent data structures
4. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error management
5. **No Testing**: Lack of tests for critical functionality
6. **Access Pattern Issues**: Inconsistent filter formats and query patterns

## Proposed Improvements

The documentation outlines a comprehensive plan to address these issues through:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Breaking down the monolith into focused modules
2. **Standardized Interfaces**: Consistent parameter and return types
3. **Strict Typing**: Type-safe operations with schema validation
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to errors
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests
6. **Incremental Migration**: Side-by-side implementation approach

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will proceed in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Audit and documentation (this folder) ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Core refactoring (standardized schemas and clients) ⏳
3. **Phase 3**: Service layer implementation ⏵
4. **Phase 4**: Testing framework ⏵
5. **Phase 5**: Migration of existing code ⏵

## Current Status

See the [Implementation Tracker](./implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md) for current progress.

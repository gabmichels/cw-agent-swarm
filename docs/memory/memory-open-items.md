## 🚧 **HIGH PRIORITY REMAINING ITEMS**

### 1. **Memory System Standardization** 
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress  
**Technical Debt Impact:** High

**Current State:**
- Multiple memory type enums exist (72 types in server config vs others)
- Inconsistent memory validation across services
- Collection configuration scattered across multiple files

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Consolidate MemoryType enums into single source of truth
- [ ] Implement unified validation system
- [ ] Standardize collection configuration
- [ ] Update all services to use standardized types

**Files Affected:**
- `src/server/memory/config/types.ts` (72 memory types)
- `src/lib/constants/memory.ts` (different memory types)
- `src/lib/file-processing/services/file-memory-storage.ts` (local enum)

### 2. **Multi-Agent Memory Communication**
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** 📋 Designed but not connected  
**Technical Debt Impact:** Medium

**Current State:**
- Enhanced Memory Service supports agent communication fields
- Multi-agent conversation manager exists but not integrated
- Agent factory exists but not connected to memory system

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Connect conversation manager to Enhanced Memory Service
- [ ] Implement agent-to-agent memory sharing protocols
- [ ] Add memory access control and permissions
- [ ] Create agent memory isolation boundaries

**Files Affected:**
- `src/server/memory/services/multi-agent/conversation-manager.ts`
- `src/server/memory/services/multi-agent/agent-factory.ts`
- `src/server/memory/services/multi-agent/enhanced-memory-service.ts`

### 3. **Performance Optimization Implementation**
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** 📋 Partially implemented  
**Technical Debt Impact:** Medium

**Current State:**
- Enhanced Memory Service has optimized filter conditions
- Top-level field extraction implemented
- Batch operations supported
- Missing: Query optimization and caching

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize vector search parameters
- [ ] Implement query plan optimization

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Implement collection versioning
- [ ] Add collection backup/restore
- [ ] Create collection health monitoring
- [ ] Implement collection archival system

### 5. **Memory Analytics & Insights**
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** 📋 Basic implementation  

**Current State:**
- Basic memory statistics available
- Missing: Advanced analytics and insights

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Implement memory usage analytics
- [ ] Add memory access pattern analysis
- [ ] Create memory health dashboards
- [ ] Implement memory optimization recommendations

---

## 🔍 **LOW PRIORITY ITEMS**

### 6. **Advanced Search Features**
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** 📋 Planned

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search capabilities
- [ ] Add semantic search improvements
- [ ] Create search result ranking
- [ ] Implement search history and suggestions

### 7. **Memory Backup & Recovery**
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** 📋 Planned

**Required Actions:**

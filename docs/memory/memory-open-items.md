**Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ enhanced-memory-service.test.ts: 2/2 tests passing
‚úÖ enhanced-memory-service.integration.test.ts: 12/12 tests passing  
‚úÖ migration-helpers.test.ts: 17/17 tests passing
Total: 31/31 tests passing (100%)
```

### ‚úÖ **Memory System Standardization** - **COMPLETED**
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED**

**What was completed:**
- ‚úÖ **MemoryType Consolidation**: Merged 4 separate MemoryType enums into single canonical source
- ‚úÖ **Import Standardization**: Updated 52+ files to use canonical import path `@/server/memory/config/types`
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors (reduced from 19 to 0)
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Added compatibility exports for existing functionality
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 38 MemoryType values properly integrated across system

**Technical Achievement:**
```
Before: 4 different MemoryType sources, 28+ import paths, 19 TS errors
After: 1 canonical source, standardized imports, 0 TS errors
Files Updated: 52+ files with standardized imports
Memory Types: 38 comprehensive types (merged from server + lib enums)
```

**Files Updated:**
- `src/server/memory/config/types.ts` - Canonical MemoryType source with all 38 types
- `src/lib/agents/shared/memory/types.ts` - Updated to use canonical imports
- `src/lib/agents/shared/memory/AgentMemory.ts` - Updated to use canonical imports
- `src/lib/agents/implementations/memory/DefaultAgentMemory.ts` - Fixed all typeDecayFactors objects
- `scripts/safe-memory-type-cleanup.ts` - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- 52+ additional files with standardized imports

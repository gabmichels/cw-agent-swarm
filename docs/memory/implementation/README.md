# Memory System Implementation Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the implementation of the memory system, including implementation guides, tracking documents, and next steps.

## Contents

- [**IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md**](./IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md) - Tracks the progress of the memory system implementation across different phases. This document serves as the central reference for understanding what has been completed and what remains to be done.

- [**IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md**](./IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md) - Provides detailed guidance for developers who are implementing the memory system. This document includes step-by-step instructions, best practices, and important considerations.

- [**NEXT_STEPS.md**](./NEXT_STEPS.md) - Outlines the upcoming tasks and priorities for the memory system implementation. This document helps in planning and prioritizing work.

## Implementation Phases

The memory system implementation is structured in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1: Analysis and Design** - Audit existing system, document issues, and design improvements ✅
2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - Implement standardized schemas and clients ⏳
3. **Phase 3: Service Layer** - Create service wrappers and abstractions ⏵
4. **Phase 4: Testing Framework** - Develop comprehensive testing approach ⏵
5. **Phase 5: Migration** - Migrate existing code to the new architecture ⏵

## Current Status

The implementation is currently in Phase 2. Key progress includes:

- Completion of system audit and documentation
- Design of standardized interfaces
- Implementation of core schema definitions
- Initial service layer implementation

See [**IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md**](./IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md) for detailed status information.

## How to Contribute to Implementation

When working on implementing the memory system:

1. Review the **IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md** to understand the approach
2. Check the **IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md** to see what needs to be done
3. Follow the standardized patterns and interfaces
4. Add tests for all new functionality
5. Update the tracking document as you complete items
6. Refer to **NEXT_STEPS.md** for priority guidance

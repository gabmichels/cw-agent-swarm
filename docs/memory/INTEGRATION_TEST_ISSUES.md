# Memory System Integration Test Issues

## Overview
We encountered several issues when running the memory system integration tests with a proper OpenAI API key:

1. **API Key Loading Issue (Fixed)**
   - We successfully implemented a utility in `src/server/memory/testing/load-api-key.ts` that correctly loads the API key from environment variables or the `.env` file.
   - All tests now properly initialize with the API key.

2. **Qdrant ID Format Issue**
   - Tests fail with errors about invalid ID formats:
     - `value test_1746450126662_message_1 is not a valid point ID, valid values are either an unsigned integer or a UUID`
   - The Qdrant client requires IDs to be either UUIDs or unsigned integers, but our tests use string IDs.

3. **Missing Memory Types**
   - `EXECUTION_OUTCOME` is defined in the `MemoryType` enum but doesn't have a dedicated collection.
   - Error: `Invalid memory type: execution_outcome`
   - The collection configuration mapping shows only a subset of memory types map to actual collections:
     - `MESSAGE`, `THOUGHT`, `DOCUMENT`, `TASK`, and `MEMORY_EDIT`

4. **Missing Search Service Methods**
   - Tests try to use methods that don't exist on the `SearchService` like `createRelationship` and `searchCausalChain`.
   - Error: `searchService.createRelationship is not a function`

## Next Steps

1. **Update Test IDs**
   - Modify test cases to use UUID-format IDs instead of string IDs.
   - Use the built-in `crypto.randomUUID()` Node.js function.

2. **Map EXECUTION_OUTCOME to a Valid Type**
   - Since EXECUTION_OUTCOME doesn't have a dedicated collection, modify tests to store it in one of the existing collections (e.g., THOUGHT or TASK) with appropriate metadata.

3. **Mock Missing Methods**
   - For relationship functionality, either implement these methods or mock them properly in the tests.

4. **Create Script to Set Up Test Collections**
   - Ensure all required collections exist in the test environment before running tests.

These changes should help make the integration tests more robust and reliable.

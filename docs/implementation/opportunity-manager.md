# Opportunity Management System: Implementation Plan

## üéØ Goal & Context

To implement a sophisticated opportunity management system that enables agents to autonomously identify, evaluate, and act on opportunities. Currently, only Chloe has this capability, but it should be available to all agents in the AgentBase framework. The current system has several gaps:

1. Opportunity detection is siloed in Chloe and not available to other agents
2. No standardized approach to opportunity evaluation and prioritization
3. Limited integration with task creation and scheduling
4. Minimal integration with memory and knowledge systems
5. No robust tracking of opportunity lifecycle
6. Lacks contextual awareness across different opportunity types

## üîç Key Discoveries

- **Chloe-Only Implementation**: The `OpportunityDetector` and related classes are currently Chloe-specific
- **Limited Opportunity Sources**: While Chloe monitors market data, news, and patterns, the system could support more sources
- **Disconnected From Task Scheduling**: Opportunity detection doesn't fully leverage the scheduling system for execution
- **Manual Time Assessment**: Time sensitivity is manually set rather than determined through NLP or context
- **No Feedback Loop**: Opportunities that lead to successful outcomes don't inform future opportunity detection
- **Missing Unified API**: No standardized interface for other agents to leverage opportunity detection

## üìù Implementation Approach 

Follow these principles when implementing the Opportunity Management System:

1. **Strictly adhere to IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md**:
   - Replace (don't extend) Chloe-specific implementation
   - Use ULID instead of timestamp-based IDs
   - Enforce strict type safety (no 'any' types)
   - Follow interface-first design
   - Use dependency injection

2. **Split into focused components**:
   - OpportunityRegistry - Storage and retrieval of opportunities
   - OpportunityDetector - Detection of potential opportunities
   - OpportunityEvaluator - Assessment of value, priority, and timing
   - OpportunityProcessor - Conversion to actionable items
   - OpportunityManager - Orchestration layer

3. **Implement diverse opportunity detection strategies**:
   - ExternalSourceStrategy - For market data, news, etc.
   - MemoryPatternStrategy - For insights from agent's memory
   - UserInteractionStrategy - For opportunities in user interactions
   - ScheduleBasedStrategy - For recurring and time-sensitive opportunities
   - CollaborationStrategy - For opportunities involving multiple agents

4. **Integrate with other systems**:
   - TaskScheduler - For executing on opportunities
   - DateTimeProcessor - For NLP-based time sensitivity assessment
   - MemorySystem - For contextual awareness and pattern recognition
   - KnowledgeGraph - For understanding relationships between entities
   - FeedbackSystem - For learning from past opportunity outcomes

## üìò Implementation Details

### Current Chloe Implementation Analysis

Chloe's implementation includes:

```typescript
// In OpportunityDetector class
export enum OpportunitySource {
  CALENDAR = 'calendar',
  MARKET_DATA = 'market_data',
  NEWS = 'news',
  MEMORY_PATTERN = 'memory_pattern',
  RECURRING_CYCLE = 'recurring_cycle'
}

export enum TimeSensitivity {
  IMMEDIATE = 'immediate',     // Within the next hour
  URGENT = 'urgent',           // Within the next 4 hours
  IMPORTANT = 'important',     // Within the next day
  STANDARD = 'standard',       // Within the next 2-3 days
  LONG_TERM = 'long_term'      // Within the next week
}

export interface DetectedOpportunity {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  created: Date;
  metadata: {
    source: OpportunitySource;
    confidence: number;
    timeSensitivity: TimeSensitivity;
    resourceNeeded?: {
      estimatedMinutes: number;
      priorityLevel: string;
    };
    patterns?: Array<{
      type: string;
      description: string;
    }>;
  };
  actionTaken: boolean;
  tags: string[];
}
```

The current implementation has detection methods like:

```typescript
private async detectMarketOpportunities(): Promise<DetectedOpportunity[]> {
  // Looks for market anomalies in market data memories
}

private async detectNewsOpportunities(): Promise<DetectedOpportunity[]> {
  // Looks for competitor mentions in news memories
}

private async detectMemoryPatterns(): Promise<DetectedOpportunity[]> {
  // Finds recurring topics in high-importance memories
}
```

### Opportunity to Task Integration

The new system improves the integration with the task system:

```typescript
// New approach for opportunity processing
interface OpportunityProcessor {
  /**
   * Process an opportunity by converting it to an executable task
   * @param opportunity The opportunity to process
   * @returns The created task ID or null if processing failed
   */
  processOpportunity(opportunity: DetectedOpportunity): Promise<string | null>;
  
  /**
   * Determine the optimal scheduling for an opportunity
   * @param opportunity The opportunity to schedule
   * @param dateTimeProcessor Reference to the DateTimeProcessor for NLP
   * @returns Scheduling metadata for the task
   */
  determineScheduling(
    opportunity: DetectedOpportunity, 
    dateTimeProcessor: DateTimeProcessor
  ): Promise<TaskSchedulingMetadata>;
  
  /**
   * Generate appropriate task metadata from an opportunity
   * @param opportunity The source opportunity
   * @returns Task metadata
   */
  generateTaskMetadata(opportunity: DetectedOpportunity): TaskMetadata;
}
```

### Modular Structure

The new structure separates concerns:

```
OpportunityManager (orchestration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityRegistry (storage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityDetector (detection)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExternalSourceStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MemoryPatternStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserInteractionStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScheduleBasedStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CollaborationStrategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityEvaluator (evaluation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityProcessor (processing)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Integration with TaskScheduler
```

### Opportunity Evaluation Improvements

Our new evaluation system considers multiple factors:

- Relevance to agent's goals and context
- Actionability of the opportunity
- Urgency and time sensitivity
- Impact of acting on the opportunity
- Confidence in the detection
- Risk assessment
- Resource efficiency

This produces a comprehensive score that determines priority.

### DefaultAutonomySystem Integration

In Phase 4, we'll create adapters to integrate with the DefaultAutonomySystem:

```typescript
// Adapter to integrate with existing DefaultOpportunityIdentifier
class LegacyOpportunityAdapter {
  /**
   * Convert from new opportunity format to legacy format
   */
  convertToLegacy(opportunity: Opportunity): LegacyOpportunity;
  
  /**
   * Convert from legacy opportunity format to new format
   */
  convertFromLegacy(legacyOpp: LegacyOpportunity): Opportunity;
  
  /**
   * Register with the DefaultAutonomySystem
   */
  registerWithAutonomySystem(autonomySystem: DefaultAutonomySystem): void;
}
```

The adapter pattern will allow a gradual migration while maintaining backward compatibility.

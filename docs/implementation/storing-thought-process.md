# Storing the Agent Thought Process: Audit & Implementation Guide

## Purpose
This document provides a detailed audit and implementation guide for storing the agent's thought process, including thoughts, reasoning, reflections, insights, and tasks. It cross-references the requirements in `process-request.md`, the current implementation in `memory.ts`, and the metadata standards in `metadata.ts`. It also includes actionable recommendations and an instruction prompt for future development, with a reminder to strictly follow `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md`.

---

## 1. Why Store the Full Thought Process?
- **Contextual Reasoning:** Enables richer, more context-aware responses by leveraging past thoughts, plans, and reflections.
- **Meta-Cognition:** Supports self-improvement and error analysis by persisting reasoning chains and critiques.
- **Advanced RAG:** Allows semantic retrieval of not just facts, but also prior reasoning and problem-solving strategies.
- **Transparency:** Facilitates debugging, auditing, and explainability.
- **Collaboration:** Enables multi-agent systems to share and build on each other's cognitive artifacts.

---

## 2. Requirements from `process-request.md`
A top-class agent should:
- ✅ Store all cognitive artifacts: thoughts, reasoning, reflections, insights, plans, tasks, and intermediate steps.
- ✅ Use structured, type-safe memory objects for each artifact.
- ✅ Integrate these memories into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and context construction.
- ✅ Ensure all stored artifacts are queryable and retrievable for future reasoning.
- ✅ Adhere to strict metadata standards for all stored items.

**Key Process Steps to Capture:**
- ✅ Intent analysis
- ✅ Context/memory retrieval
- ✅ Entity extraction
- ✅ Delegation decisions
- ✅ Planning and tool selection
- ✅ Reasoning steps (chain/tree-of-thought, etc.)
- ✅ Reflections, critiques, and insights
- ✅ Task and plan tracking

---

## 3. Current State: Audit of `memory.ts`

### What is Supported
- **MemoryEntry** supports multiple types (message, thought, reflection, document, task, etc.)
- **addMemory** method allows storing any content with type, importance, source, category, tags, and metadata.
- **Metadata** is attached to each memory, with support for custom fields.
- **Retrieval**: Methods for searching, filtering, and ranking memories by type, importance, and relevance.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic and keyword search for best recall.
- **Importance Scoring**: Automated and context-aware importance assignment.
- **Thread/Context Linking**: Thread/topic detection and linking for conversation continuity.
- **Strategic Insights**: Specialized retrieval for insights and high-importance memories.

### Gaps & Recommendations
- ✅ **Not all cognitive artifacts are always stored:**
  - ✅ Reasoning steps, intermediate plans, and reflections may not be persisted unless explicitly added as memories.
- ✅ **Metadata typing is not always enforced:**
  - ✅ Some metadata fields are loosely typed or optional; must align with `metadata.ts` interfaces.
- ✅ **No explicit reflection/insight logging step:**
  - ✅ Add a dedicated step in the agent workflow to persist reflections, critiques, and insights as first-class memory objects.
- ✅ **No universal schema for all cognitive artifacts:**
  - ✅ Use the cognitive process types and metadata interfaces from `metadata.ts` for all such artifacts.
- ✅ **ULID/UUID for IDs:**
  - ✅ Ensure all memory entries use ULID/UUID as per guidelines.

---

## 4. Metadata Standards: Alignment with `metadata.ts`
- ✅ **All stored artifacts must use the appropriate metadata interface:**
  - ✅ Thoughts: `ThoughtMetadata`
  - ✅ Reflections: `ReflectionMetadata`
  - ✅ Insights: `InsightMetadata`
  - ✅ Plans: `PlanningMetadata`
  - ✅ Tasks: `TaskMetadata`
  - ✅ Messages: `MessageMetadata`
- ✅ **Base fields required:**
  - ✅ `schemaVersion`, `source`, `timestamp`, `importance`, `tags`, `category`, and all relevant cognitive process fields.
- ✅ **Relationships:**
  - ✅ Use `relatedTo`, `influences`, `influencedBy` to link memories and support reasoning chains.
- ✅ **Strict type safety:**
  - ✅ Never use `any` types; always use the defined interfaces.

---

## 5. Implementation Recommendations

### a. Store Everything
- ✅ Persist all cognitive artifacts (thoughts, reasoning, plans, reflections, insights, tasks) as structured memory objects.
- ✅ Use the correct metadata interface for each type.
- ✅ Store intermediate steps, not just final outputs.

### b. Enforce Metadata Typing
- ✅ Validate all memory objects against the appropriate interface from `metadata.ts` before storage.
- ✅ Use factory functions (e.g., `createThoughtMetadata`) to ensure compliance.

### c. Link Memories
- ✅ Use relationship fields to connect related thoughts, plans, and reflections.
- ✅ Enable traversal and retrieval of reasoning chains.

### d. Retrieval & RAG Integration
- ✅ Index all cognitive artifacts for semantic and keyword search.
- ✅ Integrate these memories into context construction for LLMs and LangGraph workflows.

### e. Follow Implementation Guidelines
- ✅ Use ULID/UUID for all IDs.
- ✅ Strict type safety (no `any`).
- ✅ Dependency injection for all services.
- ✅ Interface-first design.
- ✅ Immutability and pure functions where possible.
- ⚠️ Test-driven development and >95% coverage. (Tests to be added)

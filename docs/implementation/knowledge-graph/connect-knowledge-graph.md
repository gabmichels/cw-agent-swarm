# Knowledge Graph Reconnection & Upgrade Implementation Plan

## **Goal & Context**
We have a sophisticated `DefaultKnowledgeGraph` implementation that's completely disconnected from our system's power tools. Currently it uses basic in-memory storage and string matching, while we have Qdrant, LangGraph, embeddings, and other advanced infrastructure sitting unused.

**Objectives:**
1. **Reconnect** the DefaultKnowledgeGraph to be the primary knowledge graph used by agents
2. **Upgrade** it to leverage Qdrant for vector storage and semantic search
3. **Integrate** LangGraph workflows for intelligent reasoning and relationship inference
4. **Implement** confidence scoring and vector embeddings for relationships
5. **Enable** persistent storage and real-time updates

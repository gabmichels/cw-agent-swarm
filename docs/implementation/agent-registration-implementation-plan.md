# Agent Registration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the agent registration process and ensuring proper utilization of registered data by agents.

## Claude Prompt Section

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE:**

When implementing file attachment functionality for the chat/[id] endpoint, follow these guidelines:

0. Don't overengineer things

1. Adhere strictly to the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md principles, particularly:
   - Replace, don't extend legacy code patterns
   - Eliminate anti-patterns completely
   - Follow strict type safety (never use 'any' type)
   - Use interface-first design
   - Create smaller, modular files (<300 lines per file)

2. Implement in a modular fashion:
   - Create focused components with clear responsibilities
   - Use dependency injection for all components
   - Define interfaces before implementations
   - Break functionality into smaller, reusable services
   - Extract reusable logic from main page implementation

3. Prioritize performance:
   - Optimize image storage and retrieval
   - Create efficient thumbnails
   - Consider memory usage for large files
   - Reuse efficient patterns from main implementation

4. Ensure comprehensive error handling:
   - Create custom error types for file operations
   - Handle all edge cases (file too large, invalid type, etc.)
   - Provide helpful error messages to users
   - Learn from error handling in main implementation

## Agent Utilization

### Prompt Construction
- [ ] Modify the DefaultAgent's prompt construction to include:
  - [ ] System prompt / custom instructions
  - [ ] Persona information (background, personality, communication style)
  - [ ] Relevant context based on the query
- [ ] Create a formatter that properly combines these elements into the prompt template
- [ ] Add a messaging module to handle formatting conversation history with persona context

### Memory Retrieval
- [ ] Enhance memory retrieval to prioritize critical memories from uploaded files
- [ ] Implement relevance scoring to include appropriate memories in prompts
- [ ] Add memory refreshing mechanism to periodically remind the agent of critical information

### Capability Integration
- [ ] Update the agent's skill selection based on registered capabilities
- [ ] Implement capability-aware tool selection
- [ ] Add capability level awareness to decision-making processes

### Knowledge Path Integration
- [ ] Implement knowledge path scanning during agent initialization
- [ ] Create a periodic scanning service to update knowledge when files in paths change
- [ ] Add a mechanism to reference knowledge path information in responses

## Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for capability storage and retrieval
- [ ] Add integration tests for the complete registration process
- [ ] Develop end-to-end tests for agent creation and subsequent operation
- [ ] Add performance tests for knowledge processing with large files

## Monitoring and Analytics

- [ ] Add tracking for which capabilities are most commonly used
- [ ] Create analytics for knowledge file usage
- [ ] Implement persona effectiveness monitoring (how well does the agent maintain its persona)
- [ ] Add system prompt impact analysis


## Agent Registration Process

### Capability Management
- [x] Create a new `capabilities` collection in the database
- [x] Modify the API endpoint to store new custom capabilities in this collection when agents are registered
- [x] Update the `AgentCapabilityManager` component to load capabilities from the database instead of hardcoded values
- [x] Add capability deduplication to prevent duplicate entries in the collection
- [x] Add capability versioning to track changes to capabilities over time

### Persona Information Processing
- [ ] Update the agent registration handler to properly store persona information (background, personality, communication style, preferences)
- [ ] Ensure persona information is easily retrievable for prompt construction
- [ ] Add validation for persona fields to ensure quality data

### System Prompt / Custom Instructions
- [ ] Ensure system prompts are properly stored and associated with the agent
- [ ] Create a retrieval mechanism for system prompts that makes them accessible during agent operation

### Knowledge Processing
- [ ] Create a preprocessing step that runs when "Finalize Agent" is clicked
- [ ] Process all uploaded markdown files:
  - [ ] Extract content and store as critical memories for the agent
  - [ ] Use tagExtractor to identify and extract tags from content
  - [ ] Associate extracted tags with stored memories
- [ ] Process all files in the selected knowledge paths:
  - [ ] Scan directories for markdown files
  - [ ] Extract content and store as critical memories
  - [ ] Use tagExtractor for tag extraction
  - [ ] Associate tags with stored memories

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Add a processing indicator during agent finalization
- [ ] Create a detailed log of processing steps for debugging
- [ ] Add error handling for failed processing attempts

## Next Steps

After implementing the above plan, we should evaluate the effectiveness of the enhancements and consider additional improvements such as:

1. Dynamic capability learning during agent operation
2. Automated persona refinement based on feedback
3. Knowledge path prioritization based on usage patterns
4. System prompt evolution through agent self-modification

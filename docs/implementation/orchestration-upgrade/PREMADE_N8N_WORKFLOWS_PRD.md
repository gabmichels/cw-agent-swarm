# Premade N8N Workflows - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🎯 **Product Vision**

Integrate the [Zie619/n8n-workflows repository](https://github.com/Zie619/n8n-workflows) - a **sophisticated workflow management platform** with 2,053 professionally organized workflows - into our Agent Swarm ecosystem as a **comprehensive workflow discovery and import system**.

### **Repository Integration Scope**
Instead of building workflow discovery from scratch, we'll leverage their **complete infrastructure**:
- **FastAPI server** with sub-100ms search performance across 2,053 workflows
- **SQLite database** with FTS5 full-text search and professional categorization
- **365 unique integrations** automatically detected and organized into 12 service categories
- **Smart workflow intelligence** including complexity analysis, trigger detection, and service mapping

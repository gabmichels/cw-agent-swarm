# UI Capabilities Audit

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive audit of necessary UI components needed to fully leverage the Agent Core Platform's capabilities after the architecture refactoring. Our goal is to identify gaps in the current UI, recommend new interfaces, and ensure operators have complete visibility and control over the agent system.

The audit is based on the current architectural capabilities (85% of refactoring complete) with a focus on operational efficiency, transparency, and effective agent oversight.

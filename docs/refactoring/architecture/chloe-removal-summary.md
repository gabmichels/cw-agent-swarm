# Chloe Agent Removal - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the codebase as part of removing the Chloe agent system. The goal was to follow the architecture refactoring guidelines in `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md` while making the code more maintainable and properly typed.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Implemented Bridge Files
Created bridge files to maintain import compatibility:
- `src/agents/shared/base/AgentBase.ts` - Main bridge file for AgentBase interface
- `src/lib/agents/base/AgentBase.ts` - Secondary bridge file for AgentBase interface
- `src/lib/agents/base/managers/BaseManager.ts` - Re-export of BaseManager

### 2. Implemented Missing Interfaces
- Created proper `KnowledgeGapsManager` interface that adheres to strict typing guidelines
- Created placeholder ResearchAgent implementation
- Removed "any" types in favor of properly defined interfaces
- Added proper type definitions to various manager interfaces

### 3. Fixed Broken References
- Updated imports across the codebase to use the new bridge files
- Properly implemented AbstractAgentBase and related types

### 4. Removed Chloe-Specific Files
- Completely deleted:
  - `src/scripts/run-chloe-scheduler.ts`
  - `src/scheduledTasks/chloe.ts`
  - `src/cli/chloe.ts`
  - `src/app/api/check-chloe/route.ts`
- Stubbed temporarily (to be removed later):
  - `src/lib/singletons/chloeAgent.ts` - Stubbed implementation with deprecation warnings
- Commented out for reference:
  - `src/agents/example-usage.ts`

### 5. Fixed Frontend Components
- `src/app/agents/new/page.tsx` - Created local type definition to replace Chloe-specific import

### 6. Testing Framework Migration
- Updated tests to use Vitest instead of Jest
- Replaced Jest-specific imports and functions:
  ```typescript
  // INCORRECT - Jest imports
  import { describe, it, expect, jest } from '@jest/globals';
  
  // CORRECT - Vitest imports
  import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
  ```
- Replaced function calls:
  - `jest.fn()` → `vi.fn()`
  - `jest.mock()` → `vi.mock()`
  - `jest.spyOn()` → `vi.spyOn()`

## Current Status
- TypeScript errors reduced from 684 to 664 (20 errors fixed, 20+ stubs created)
- Several files have been removed entirely
- Manager interfaces have been properly defined with strict typing

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining manager interfaces with proper type safety
2. Create proper implementations for stubbed files
3. Update remaining UI components that might reference the old Chloe agent
4. Create comprehensive tests for the new architecture

## Long-Term Plan
1. Remove all Chloe-related code completely
2. Migrate any remaining functionality from the Chloe system to new components
3. Ensure strict type safety throughout the codebase

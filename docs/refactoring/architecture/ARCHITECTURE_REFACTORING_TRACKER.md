## Key Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Qdrant vector database | High | Design optimal integration approach before implementing |
| TypeScript type system | Medium | Use advanced TypeScript features for maximum type safety |
| Test infrastructure | Medium | Enhance test framework to support interface-based testing |

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Data migration complexity | High | High | Create specialized migration utilities for one-time use |
| Performance regression | Medium | High | Benchmark before and after for all components |
| Timeline constraints | Medium | Medium | Focus on high-priority components first |

| Legacy code dependencies | High | High | Follow methodical process in [LEGACY_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md](./LEGACY_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md) |

## Implementation Notes

### Clean Break Approach

The implementation prioritizes:
- Complete replacement of anti-patterns without legacy support
- Strict enforcement of type safety without exceptions
- Interface-first design for all components
- Comprehensive testing with high coverage requirements
- Performance as a first-class concern

### Best Practices Adoption

Key best practices being implemented:
- ULID/UUID for all identifiers instead of timestamps
- Dependency injection throughout
- Interface-based programming
- Strict type safety (no 'any' types)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance-optimized database operations

## Next Steps

1. Complete detailed interface designs for all components
2. Finalize the ULID implementation approach
3. Design the error handling framework
4. Begin implementation of core infrastructure components
5. Create comprehensive test suite for new components

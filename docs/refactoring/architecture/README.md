# Architecture Refactoring Project

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the comprehensive architecture refactoring project aimed at addressing issues identified in the July 2025 architectural audit. The project focuses on improving memory system consistency, modularization, database operations, knowledge graph functionality, error handling, and documentation.

## Project Status

| Phase | Status | Timeline | Completion % |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Planning & Design | ✅ Completed | Week 1-2 | 100% |
| 2. Core Infrastructure | ⚪ Not Started | Week 3-6 | 0% |
| 3. Feature Implementation | ⚪ Not Started | Week 7-10 | 0% |
| 4. Cleanup & Validation | ⚪ Not Started | Week 11-12 | 0% |

**Overall Progress:** 25% - Design phase completed, ready to begin implementation

## Key Documents

- [**ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PROMPT.md**](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PROMPT.md) - Detailed instruction prompt outlining the goals, requirements, and implementation approach for the refactoring project.
- [**ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_TRACKER.md**](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_TRACKER.md) - Comprehensive tracker documenting the project's progress, task status, and implementation details.
- [**IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md**](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md) - Guidelines for implementing the refactoring, including coding standards and best practices.
- [**designs/**](./designs/) - Detailed design documents for all components of the refactoring project.

## Design Documentation

The [designs](./designs/) directory contains detailed design documents for each component:

- **ULID Implementation Design** - Design for replacing timestamp-based IDs with ULIDs
- **Memory Service Design** - Design for type-safe memory service wrappers
- **Error Handling Framework** - Design for standardized error handling across the system
- **Schema Versioning Strategy** - Design for managing data schema evolution
- **Component Interfaces** - Design for component interfaces with clean separation of concerns

## Project Goals

1. **Enhance Memory System Consistency**: Complete the metadata refactoring and ensure consistent usage of new patterns
2. **Improve Modularization**: Decompose large modules into smaller, focused components
3. **Optimize Database Operations**: Enhance Qdrant vector database interactions for better performance and reliability
4. **Replace Placeholder Implementations**: Convert mock implementations into production-ready code
5. **Standardize Error Handling**: Create a consistent approach to error management
6. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation accurately reflects current implementations

## High-Priority Focus Areas

1. **GraphIntelligenceEngine**: Replace placeholder implementations with production-ready LLM-based solutions
2. **Large Module Decomposition**: Break down oversized modules (`FileProcessor`, `ToolFallbackManager`, `QdrantMemoryClient`)
3. **Legacy Memory Structure**: Complete the transition to the new memory architecture
4. **Tool Error Handling**: Centralize and standardize error handling across all tool operations

## Implementation Approach

The project follows these key principles:

1. **Clean Break from Legacy Code**: Completely replace flawed implementations rather than maintaining backward compatibility
2. **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementation details
3. **Strict Type Safety**: Enforce type safety throughout the system, with no use of `any` types
4. **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
5. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a focused responsibility 
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure thorough test coverage for all components

## Next Steps

With the design phase completed, the project will now move into the Core Infrastructure implementation phase:

1. **Implement ULID/UUID generator**: Complete replacement for timestamp IDs
2. **Build memory service base classes**: With enforced type safety
3. **Implement error framework**: Centralized approach with error type hierarchy
4. **Create schema validation system**: With strict enforcement

## Getting Involved

To contribute to this refactoring project:

1. Review the [refactoring prompt](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PROMPT.md) to understand the goals and requirements
2. Check the [tracker](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_TRACKER.md) for current status and available tasks
3. Follow the [implementation guidelines](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md) for coding standards
4. Review the detailed [design documents](./designs/) before implementing any component

# Architecture Refactoring Project

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the comprehensive architecture refactoring project aimed at addressing issues identified in the July 2025 architectural audit. The project focuses on improving memory system consistency, modularization, database operations, knowledge graph functionality, error handling, and documentation.

## Key Documents

- [**ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PROMPT.md**](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PROMPT.md) - Detailed instruction prompt outlining the goals, requirements, and implementation approach for the refactoring project.
- [**ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_TRACKER.md**](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_TRACKER.md) - Comprehensive tracker documenting the project's progress, task status, and implementation details.

## Project Goals

1. **Enhance Memory System Consistency**: Complete the metadata refactoring and ensure consistent usage of new patterns
2. **Improve Modularization**: Decompose large modules into smaller, focused components
3. **Optimize Database Operations**: Enhance Qdrant vector database interactions for better performance and reliability
4. **Replace Placeholder Implementations**: Convert mock implementations into production-ready code
5. **Standardize Error Handling**: Create a consistent approach to error management
6. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation accurately reflects current implementations

## High-Priority Focus Areas

1. **GraphIntelligenceEngine**: Replace placeholder implementations with production-ready LLM-based solutions
2. **Large Module Decomposition**: Break down oversized modules (`FileProcessor`, `ToolFallbackManager`, `QdrantMemoryClient`)
3. **Legacy Memory Structure**: Complete the transition to the new memory architecture
4. **Tool Error Handling**: Centralize and standardize error handling across all tool operations

## Project Timeline

The refactoring project is scheduled for completion in 12 weeks, divided into four phases:

1. **Planning & Setup** (Weeks 1-2): Detailed planning, creating test fixtures, establishing baselines
2. **Core Infrastructure** (Weeks 3-6): Addressing high-priority infrastructure components
3. **Feature Enhancements** (Weeks 7-10): Implementing medium-priority improvements
4. **Cleanup & Documentation** (Weeks 11-12): Addressing low-priority items and ensuring comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Approach

The project follows these key principles:

1. **Incremental Changes**: Small, manageable increments to minimize disruption
2. **Test-Driven**: Each change accompanied by tests to ensure functionality preservation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility where possible, with clear migration paths
4. **Documentation First**: Updating documentation alongside code changes
5. **Performance Aware**: Monitoring metrics to ensure improvements

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. All high-priority issues have been fully addressed
2. Medium-priority issues have been substantially improved
3. Code quality metrics show measurable improvement
4. System performance metrics demonstrate equal or better performance
5. Documentation accurately reflects the current implementation
6. All tests pass with at least 90% code coverage for refactored components

## Getting Involved

To contribute to this refactoring project:

1. Review the [refactoring prompt](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_PROMPT.md) to understand the goals and requirements
2. Check the [tracker](./ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING_TRACKER.md) for current status and available tasks
3. Follow the coding standards outlined in the tracker
4. Update the tracker as you make progress on assigned tasks

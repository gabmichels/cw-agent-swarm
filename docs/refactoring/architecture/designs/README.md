# Architecture Refactoring Design Documents

This directory contains detailed design documents for the architecture refactoring project. These designs serve as the blueprint for the implementation phase, providing clear guidelines and specifications for each component.

## Design Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [ULID Implementation Design](./ULID_IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN.md) | Design for replacing timestamp-based IDs with ULIDs | ✅ Completed |
| [Memory Service Design](./MEMORY_SERVICE_DESIGN.md) | Design for type-safe memory service wrappers | ✅ Completed |
| [Error Handling Framework](./ERROR_HANDLING_FRAMEWORK.md) | Design for standardized error handling across the system | ✅ Completed |
| [Schema Versioning Strategy](./SCHEMA_VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md) | Design for managing data schema evolution | ✅ Completed |
| [Component Interfaces](./COMPONENT_INTERFACES.md) | Design for component interfaces with clean separation of concerns | ✅ Completed |

## Design Principles

All designs follow these core principles:

1. **Clean Break from Legacy Code**: Designs prioritize completely replacing flawed implementations rather than maintaining backward compatibility
2. **Interface-First Approach**: All components are defined by their interfaces before implementation details
3. **Strict Type Safety**: Type safety is enforced throughout the system, with no use of `any` types
4. **Dependency Injection**: All components use constructor injection for dependencies
5. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a focused responsibility
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Testability is designed in from the beginning

## Next Steps

These designs will guide the implementation phase of the refactoring project:

1. **Core Infrastructure Implementation**: The first implementation focus will be on the core infrastructure components outlined in these designs
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Each component will be implemented with tests first
3. **Incremental Rollout**: Components will be implemented and tested incrementally
4. **Validation**: Each implementation will be validated against its design

## Design Updates

If significant changes are required during implementation, these design documents will be updated to reflect the actual implementation. All changes must adhere to the core design principles.

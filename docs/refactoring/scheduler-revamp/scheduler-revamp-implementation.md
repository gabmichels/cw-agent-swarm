# Scheduler System Revamp: Implementation Plan

## üéØ Goal & Context

To refactor the DefaultSchedulerManager into a more modular, maintainable system that correctly handles task scheduling and execution according to the architecture guidelines. The current system has several issues:

1. Tasks are not being executed despite being in the queue (102 tasks with "No due tasks found")
2. Missing execution paths for tasks without explicit scheduling metadata
3. Multiple scheduler instances running simultaneously 
4. Excessive code complexity (2,400+ lines) with many unreferenced methods
5. Non-compliance with implementation guidelines (uses timestamp IDs, any types, etc.)
6. Inconsistent date/time parsing across the codebase

## üîç Key Discoveries

- **Task Execution Criteria Gap**: Tasks are only considered "due" if they have explicit `scheduledTime` or interval scheduling
- **No Priority-Based Fallback**: No mechanism to execute pending tasks based on priority when there's no explicit scheduling
- **Duplicate Schedulers**: Logs show multiple scheduler instances with different IDs all polling simultaneously
- **Overly Complex Implementation**: Current structure doesn't follow SRP and contains mixed responsibilities
- **Inconsistent Date/Time Parsing**: Different components use different approaches to parse dates and times

## üìù Implementation Approach 

Follow these principles when implementing the revamp:

1. **Strictly adhere to IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md**:
   - Replace (don't extend) legacy code
   - Use ULID instead of timestamp-based IDs
   - Enforce strict type safety (no 'any' types)
   - Follow interface-first design
   - Use dependency injection

2. **Split into focused components**:
   - TaskRegistry - Storage and retrieval of tasks
   - TaskScheduler - Scheduling logic and timing
   - TaskExecutor - Execution of tasks
   - SchedulerManager - Orchestration layer
   - DateTimeProcessor - Shared NLP for date/time parsing

3. **Implement diverse scheduling strategies**:
   - ExplicitTimeScheduling - For tasks with specific times
   - IntervalScheduling - For recurring tasks
   - PriorityBasedScheduling - Fallback for high-priority tasks

4. **Add proper diagnostics and monitoring**:
   - Task execution tracing
   - Performance metrics
   - Clear error states

## üìò Implementation Details

### Task Scheduling Improvement

The core issue we need to fix is the task execution criteria. Currently, tasks are only executed when:

```typescript
// Current logic in getDueTasks()
if (scheduledTime) {
  // Parse the scheduled time (handle both Date objects and ISO strings)
  let taskTime: Date;
  
  if (scheduledTime instanceof Date) {
    taskTime = scheduledTime;
  } else if (typeof scheduledTime === 'string') {
    taskTime = new Date(scheduledTime);
  } else if (typeof scheduledTime === 'number') {
    taskTime = new Date(scheduledTime);
  } else {
    return false; // Invalid scheduledTime format
  }
  
  // Compare with current time
  return taskTime <= now;
}

// OR 

if (scheduleType === 'interval') {
  // Interval based logic
}
```

We need to add a third path for priority-based execution:

```typescript
// New logic to add
if (!scheduledTime && scheduleType !== 'interval' && 
    task.status === 'pending' && task.priority >= HIGH_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD) {
  return true; // High priority tasks are due even without scheduling
}
```

### Modular Structure

The new structure will separate concerns:

```
ModularSchedulerManager (orchestration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskRegistry (storage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskScheduler (scheduling)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExplicitTimeStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IntervalStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PriorityBasedStrategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskExecutor (execution)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DateTimeProcessor (shared)
```

This follows the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md principle of breaking down large classes into focused components.

### Shared DateTimeProcessor with NLP

To ensure consistent date/time parsing across the codebase, we'll implement a sophisticated DateTimeProcessor component with natural language processing capabilities:

```typescript
interface DateTimeProcessor {
  /**
   * Parse a natural language date/time expression into a standardized Date object
   * @param expression The natural language expression to parse (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Tuesday", "in 3 days")
   * @param referenceDate Optional reference date (defaults to current time)
   * @returns The parsed Date object or null if parsing fails
   */
  parseNaturalLanguage(expression: string, referenceDate?: Date): Date | null;
  
  /**
   * Format a Date object into a standardized string representation
   * @param date The date to format
   * @param format Optional format specification
   * @returns Formatted date string
   */
  formatDate(date: Date, format?: string): string;
  
  /**
   * Calculate a new date based on an interval description
   * @param baseDate The starting date
   * @param interval The interval description (e.g., "2 days", "1 week", "3 months")
   * @returns The calculated Date object
   */
  calculateInterval(baseDate: Date, interval: string): Date;
  
  /**
   * Check if a date has passed relative to the current time or a reference time
   * @param date The date to check
   * @param referenceDate Optional reference date (defaults to current time)
   * @returns True if the date has passed
   */
  hasPassed(date: Date, referenceDate?: Date): boolean;
  
  /**
   * Generate a cron expression from a natural language description
   * @param expression Natural language expression for recurring schedule
   * @returns Valid cron expression
   */
  generateCronExpression(expression: string): string;
}
```

The DateTimeProcessor will support:

1. **Natural Language Parsing**: Process expressions like "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 3 days", "end of month"
2. **Time Zone Handling**: Properly handle time zones and DST transitions
3. **Relative Expressions**: Handle relative time expressions like "in 2 hours" or "3 weeks from now"
4. **Recurring Schedules**: Parse expressions like "every Monday" or "first day of each month"
5. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle slight variations in expression format
6. **Multilingual Support**: Eventually support multiple languages

The implementation will use a proven NLP library (such as Chrono.js or date-fns) with a standardized interface, ensuring all parts of the codebase handle dates and times consistently. 

### Direct Migration Process

Since we're the only developer and want to migrate everything directly:

1. Identify all DefaultSchedulerManager usages
2. Replace each with the factory approach in a single sweep
3. Fix any TypeScript errors
4. Delete the DefaultSchedulerManager file once all usages are migrated
5. Run tests to verify everything works correctly

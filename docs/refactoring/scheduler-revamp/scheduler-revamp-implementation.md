# Scheduler System Revamp: Implementation Plan

## üéØ Goal & Context

To refactor the DefaultSchedulerManager into a more modular, maintainable system that correctly handles task scheduling and execution according to the architecture guidelines. The current system has several issues:

1. Tasks are not being executed despite being in the queue (102 tasks with "No due tasks found")
2. Missing execution paths for tasks without explicit scheduling metadata
3. Multiple scheduler instances running simultaneously 
4. Excessive code complexity (2,400+ lines) with many unreferenced methods
5. Non-compliance with implementation guidelines (uses timestamp IDs, any types, etc.)
6. Inconsistent date/time parsing across the codebase

## üîç Key Discoveries

- **Task Execution Criteria Gap**: Tasks are only considered "due" if they have explicit `scheduledTime` or interval scheduling
- **No Priority-Based Fallback**: No mechanism to execute pending tasks based on priority when there's no explicit scheduling
- **Duplicate Schedulers**: Logs show multiple scheduler instances with different IDs all polling simultaneously
- **Overly Complex Implementation**: Current structure doesn't follow SRP and contains mixed responsibilities
- **Inconsistent Date/Time Parsing**: Different components use different approaches to parse dates and times

## üìù Implementation Approach 

Follow these principles when implementing the revamp:

1. **Strictly adhere to IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md**:
   - Replace (don't extend) legacy code
   - Use ULID instead of timestamp-based IDs
   - Enforce strict type safety (no 'any' types)
   - Follow interface-first design
   - Use dependency injection

2. **Split into focused components**:
   - TaskRegistry - Storage and retrieval of tasks
   - TaskScheduler - Scheduling logic and timing
   - TaskExecutor - Execution of tasks
   - SchedulerManager - Orchestration layer
   - DateTimeProcessor - Shared NLP for date/time parsing

3. **Implement diverse scheduling strategies**:
   - ExplicitTimeScheduling - For tasks with specific times
   - IntervalScheduling - For recurring tasks
   - PriorityBasedScheduling - Fallback for high-priority tasks

4. **Add proper diagnostics and monitoring**:
   - Task execution tracing
   - Performance metrics
   - Clear error states

**Agent ID Filtering Implementation Summary**:
The agent ID filtering implementation has been successfully completed, addressing the identified gap in task isolation for multi-agent systems. This implementation ensures that tasks are properly assigned to specific agents and that agents only execute their own tasks.

Key achievements in agent ID filtering:
1. Enhanced `TaskFilter` interface to support nested metadata filtering for agent IDs
2. Added agent-specific methods to `ModularSchedulerManager`:
   - `findTasksForAgent(agentId, filter)` - Find tasks for a specific agent
   - `createTaskForAgent(task, agentId)` - Create a task for a specific agent
   - `executeDueTasksForAgent(agentId)` - Execute due tasks for a specific agent
3. Updated `MemoryTaskRegistry` to support nested object filtering in metadata
4. Created factory function `createSchedulerManagerForAgent` for agent-specific schedulers
5. Implemented comprehensive tests for agent ID filtering
6. Created migration guide with emphasis on using `createTaskForAgent`
7. Developed an audit script to identify improper task creation in the codebase
8. Created PR checklist for agent ID filtering implementation
9. Fixed identified instances of direct `createTask` usage:
   - Updated `src/lib/scheduler/examples/usage-with-factory.ts` to use `createTaskForAgent`
   - Enhanced `src/agents/shared/coordination/CapabilitySystemDemo.ts` with backward compatibility support

**CRITICAL MIGRATION REQUIREMENT**: When migrating from DefaultSchedulerManager to ModularSchedulerManager, **always use `createTaskForAgent` instead of `createTask`** to ensure proper agent ID assignment. This is essential for the correct functioning of agent-specific task filtering and execution.

Example of proper task creation:
```typescript
// CORRECT - Always use this pattern
const task = await scheduler.createTaskForAgent({
  name: 'My Task',
  // other task properties
}, 'agent-id');
```

For backward compatibility with existing code using the legacy `DefaultSchedulerManager` that doesn't have the `createTaskForAgent` method, we've implemented a fallback mechanism:

```typescript
// Type assertion for backward compatibility
const modernScheduler = scheduler as unknown as { 
  createTaskForAgent?: (task: TaskCreationOptions, agentId: string) => Promise<TaskCreationResult> 
};

// Use createTaskForAgent if available, otherwise fall back to createTask
if (typeof modernScheduler.createTaskForAgent === 'function') {
  return modernScheduler.createTaskForAgent(taskOptions, agentId);
} else {
  // Fall back to createTask but add agent ID to metadata
  if (!taskOptions.metadata) {
    taskOptions.metadata = {};
  }
  
  // Add agent ID to metadata
  taskOptions.metadata.agentId = {
    namespace: 'agent',
    type: 'agent',
    id: agentId
  };
  
  return scheduler.createTask(taskOptions);
}
```

The agent ID filtering implementation provides a robust foundation for multi-agent systems using the scheduler. Future work should focus on auditing existing code to ensure all task creation properly sets agent IDs, optimizing performance, and adding more advanced agent capabilities.

**DateTimeProcessor Integration Summary**:
The DateTimeProcessor has been successfully integrated across the codebase, ensuring consistent date/time parsing and formatting throughout the application. This integration addresses the issue of inconsistent date/time handling that was identified in the original system.

Key achievements in DateTimeProcessor integration:
1. Created a singleton `DateTimeService` that wraps the `BasicDateTimeProcessor`
2. Implemented server-side utility functions for date/time operations
3. Implemented client-side utility functions for date/time formatting and comparison
4. Added comprehensive unit tests for the DateTimeService
5. Created an integration plan for updating all date/time handling code

The DateTimeService provides the following capabilities:
- Natural language date parsing (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Friday")
- Vague term translation (e.g., "urgent", "soon")
- Date formatting and standardization
- Relative time descriptions (e.g., "2 days ago")
- Date comparison and manipulation

This integration ensures that all parts of the application handle dates and times consistently, improving reliability and maintainability.

## üîç Identified Gaps

### Agent ID Filtering
The current implementation doesn't properly filter tasks by agent ID, which could lead to tasks being executed by unintended agents in a multi-agent system. Specific issues include:

1. **Task Creation**: When creating tasks, the agent ID is currently hardcoded as "default" in the metadata rather than using the actual agent ID:
   ```typescript
   metadata: {
     agentId: {
       namespace: "agent",
       type: "agent",
       id: "default" // Should be the actual agent ID
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Task Filtering**: There's no automatic filtering mechanism to ensure agents only execute their own tasks. The `findTasks()` method doesn't specifically handle agent-based filtering.

3. **Required Enhancements**:
   - ‚úÖ Extend TaskFilter to support metadata filtering with agent ID
   - ‚úÖ Add agent-specific methods like `findTasksForAgent(agentId)`
   - ‚úÖ Ensure task creation stores the correct agent ID
   - ‚úÖ Update the scheduler to automatically filter by agent ID during polling
   - ‚úÖ Add tests to verify agent-specific task isolation

This gap has been addressed with the agent ID filtering implementation.

Phase 5: [xx        ] 20%
```

**Phase 4 Partial Completion Summary**:
Phase 4 is currently in progress with several key components completed. While we've successfully implemented agent ID filtering, integrated the DateTimeProcessor, and added backward compatibility support, there are still important tasks remaining.

Key achievements so far:
1. Added transition support with backward compatibility
2. Documented the new API and usage patterns in README.md
3. Integrated DateTimeProcessor across the codebase
4. Implemented agent ID filtering
5. Created audit tools to identify improper task creation
6. Added proper error handling and logging
7. Updated documentation with migration guides
8. Verified functionality with comprehensive tests
9. Implemented proper agentId handling in task metadata

Critical remaining tasks:
1. Migrate all DefaultSchedulerManager instances to ModularSchedulerManager
2. Create and execute data migration utilities for existing tasks
3. Complete full system integration testing after migration

These remaining tasks are essential for ensuring a smooth transition from the legacy scheduler to the new system. The next phase will involve systematically replacing all instances of DefaultSchedulerManager and migrating existing tasks to the new format.

## üìò Implementation Details

### Task Scheduling Improvement

The core issue we need to fix is the task execution criteria. Currently, tasks are only executed when:

```typescript
// Current logic in getDueTasks()
if (scheduledTime) {
  // Parse the scheduled time (handle both Date objects and ISO strings)
  let taskTime: Date;
  
  if (scheduledTime instanceof Date) {
    taskTime = scheduledTime;
  } else if (typeof scheduledTime === 'string') {
    taskTime = new Date(scheduledTime);
  } else if (typeof scheduledTime === 'number') {
    taskTime = new Date(scheduledTime);
  } else {
    return false; // Invalid scheduledTime format
  }
  
  // Compare with current time
  return taskTime <= now;
}

// OR 

if (scheduleType === 'interval') {
  // Interval based logic
}
```

We need to add a third path for priority-based execution:

```typescript
// New logic to add
if (!scheduledTime && scheduleType !== 'interval' && 
    task.status === 'pending' && task.priority >= HIGH_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD) {
  return true; // High priority tasks are due even without scheduling
}
```

### Modular Structure

The new structure will separate concerns:

```
ModularSchedulerManager (orchestration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskRegistry (storage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskScheduler (scheduling)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExplicitTimeStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IntervalStrategy
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PriorityBasedStrategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskExecutor (execution)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DateTimeProcessor (shared)
```

This follows the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md principle of breaking down large classes into focused components.

### Shared DateTimeProcessor with NLP

To ensure consistent date/time parsing across the codebase, we'll implement a sophisticated DateTimeProcessor component with natural language processing capabilities:

```typescript
interface DateTimeProcessor {
  /**
   * Parse a natural language date/time expression into a standardized Date object
   * @param expression The natural language expression to parse (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Tuesday", "in 3 days")
   * @param referenceDate Optional reference date (defaults to current time)
   * @returns The parsed Date object or null if parsing fails
   */
  parseNaturalLanguage(expression: string, referenceDate?: Date): Date | null;
  
  /**
   * Format a Date object into a standardized string representation
   * @param date The date to format
   * @param format Optional format specification
   * @returns Formatted date string
   */
  formatDate(date: Date, format?: string): string;
  
  /**
   * Calculate a new date based on an interval description
   * @param baseDate The starting date
   * @param interval The interval description (e.g., "2 days", "1 week", "3 months")
   * @returns The calculated Date object
   */
  calculateInterval(baseDate: Date, interval: string): Date;
  
  /**
   * Check if a date has passed relative to the current time or a reference time
   * @param date The date to check
   * @param referenceDate Optional reference date (defaults to current time)
   * @returns True if the date has passed
   */
  hasPassed(date: Date, referenceDate?: Date): boolean;
  
  /**
   * Generate a cron expression from a natural language description
   * @param expression Natural language expression for recurring schedule
   * @returns Valid cron expression
   */
  generateCronExpression(expression: string): string;
}
```

The DateTimeProcessor will support:

1. **Natural Language Parsing**: Process expressions like "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 3 days", "end of month"
2. **Time Zone Handling**: Properly handle time zones and DST transitions
3. **Relative Expressions**: Handle relative time expressions like "in 2 hours" or "3 weeks from now"
4. **Recurring Schedules**: Parse expressions like "every Monday" or "first day of each month"
5. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle slight variations in expression format
6. **Multilingual Support**: Eventually support multiple languages

The implementation will use a proven NLP library (such as Chrono.js or date-fns) with a standardized interface, ensuring all parts of the codebase handle dates and times consistently. 

### Direct Migration Process

Since we're the only developer and want to migrate everything directly:

1. Identify all DefaultSchedulerManager usages
2. Replace each with the factory approach in a single sweep
3. Fix any TypeScript errors
4. Delete the DefaultSchedulerManager file once all usages are migrated
5. Run tests to verify everything works correctly 

### Agent ID Filtering Implementation

The agent ID filtering implementation ensures proper task isolation in multi-agent environments:

1. **Enhanced Metadata Structure**:
   ```typescript
   metadata: {
     agentId: {
       namespace: 'agent',
       type: 'agent',
       id: 'agent-123'
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Agent-Specific Methods**:
   ```typescript
   // Find tasks for a specific agent
   findTasksForAgent(agentId: string, filter?: TaskFilter): Promise<Task[]>;
   
   // Create a task for a specific agent
   createTaskForAgent(task: Task, agentId: string): Promise<Task>;
   
   // Execute due tasks for a specific agent
   executeDueTasksForAgent(agentId: string): Promise<TaskExecutionResult[]>;
   ```

3. **Agent-Specific Scheduler Factory**:
   ```typescript
   // Create a scheduler that automatically filters by agent ID
   const agentScheduler = await createSchedulerManagerForAgent(config, 'agent-123');
   ```

4. **Migration Requirements**:
   - Always use `createTaskForAgent` instead of `createTask`
   - Use agent-specific methods for filtering and execution
   - Verify all tasks have proper agent ID metadata

### Testing Strategy

The testing approach for the scheduler system will focus on practical validation scenarios rather than exhaustive test coverage. We're prioritizing:

1. **Unit Testing (Completed)**
   - Basic component functionality verification
   - Data flow within individual components
   - Boundary cases and error handling

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Component interaction testing
   - Verify that ModularSchedulerManager properly orchestrates all subcomponents
   - Test the factory methods for creating scheduler instances

3. **Real-World Testing**
   - Leverage the existing tests/autonomy directory for real agent scenarios
   - Test the scheduler with typical agent workflows
   - Verify scheduling behaviors match expected patterns in production-like environments

4. **Migration Testing**
   - Create tests that validate the transition from DefaultSchedulerManager
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing agent implementations
   - Verify that factory-created schedulers behave identically to legacy implementations

5. **Agent ID Filtering Testing**
   - Test creating tasks with agent ID
   - Test finding tasks for specific agents
   - Test executing tasks for specific agents
   - Verify that agents only execute their own tasks

# Scheduler Revamp Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Agent ID Filtering

✅ Enhanced `TaskFilter` interface to support nested metadata filtering for agent IDs
✅ Added agent-specific methods to `ModularSchedulerManager`:
   - `findTasksForAgent(agentId, filter)`
   - `createTaskForAgent(task, agentId)`
   - `executeDueTasksForAgent(agentId)`
✅ Updated `MemoryTaskRegistry` to support nested object filtering in metadata
✅ Created factory function `createSchedulerManagerForAgent` for agent-specific schedulers
✅ Implemented comprehensive tests for agent ID filtering
✅ Created design documentation for agent ID filtering
✅ Created implementation plan for agent ID filtering
✅ Created migration guide with emphasis on using `createTaskForAgent`
✅ Developed audit script to identify direct uses of `createTask`
✅ Created PR checklist for agent ID filtering implementation

### Testing

✅ Added tests for the ModularScheduler to verify:
   - Task polling functionality
   - Handling of multiple scheduling scenarios
   - Task prioritization
   - Handling complex task structures
✅ Created tests for agent ID filtering:
   - Creating tasks with agent ID
   - Finding tasks for specific agents
   - Executing tasks for specific agents

## Next Steps

1. **Audit Existing Code**
   - [x] Run audit script to identify direct uses of `createTask`
   - [ ] Fix identified instances of direct `createTask` usage:
     - `src/agents/shared/coordination/CapabilitySystemDemo.ts`
     - `src/lib/scheduler/examples/usage-with-factory.ts`
   - [ ] Update task queries to use agent-specific filtering where appropriate
   - [ ] Add warnings in `createTask` documentation to use `createTaskForAgent` instead

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - [x] Update API documentation to include agent-specific methods
   - [x] Create usage examples for agent-specific schedulers
   - [x] Document the agent ID metadata structure

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Consider indexing agent IDs in the task registry for faster filtering
   - [ ] Benchmark agent filtering performance with large task sets
   - [ ] Optimize nested metadata filtering logic

4. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Add support for agent groups (tasks that can be executed by multiple agents)
   - [ ] Implement agent capabilities (tasks that require specific agent capabilities)
   - [ ] Add agent status tracking (active, idle, busy)

## Documentation Created

1. `docs/refactoring/scheduler-revamp/agent-filtering-design.md` - Design document for agent ID filtering
2. `docs/refactoring/scheduler-revamp/agent-filtering-implementation.md` - Implementation plan for agent ID filtering
3. `docs/refactoring/scheduler-revamp/implementation-summary.md` - Summary of completed tasks and next steps
4. `docs/refactoring/scheduler-revamp/migration-guide.md` - Guide for migrating from DefaultSchedulerManager to ModularSchedulerManager
5. `docs/refactoring/scheduler-revamp/agent-filtering-pr-checklist.md` - PR checklist for agent ID filtering implementation

## Tests Created

1. `tests/scheduler/ModularSchedulerAdvanced.test.ts` - Advanced tests for the ModularScheduler
2. `tests/scheduler/AgentTaskFilteringImplementation.test.ts` - Tests for agent ID filtering implementation

## Code Changes

1. Enhanced `TaskFilter` interface in `src/lib/scheduler/models/TaskFilter.model.ts`
2. Updated `MemoryTaskRegistry` in `src/lib/scheduler/implementations/registry/MemoryTaskRegistry.ts`
3. Added agent-specific methods to `ModularSchedulerManager` in `src/lib/scheduler/implementations/ModularSchedulerManager.ts`
4. Created factory function `createSchedulerManagerForAgent` in `src/lib/scheduler/factories/SchedulerFactory.ts`

## Audit Results

The audit script identified 2 files with direct uses of `createTask` that need to be updated:

1. `src/agents/shared/coordination/CapabilitySystemDemo.ts` (1 instance)
2. `src/lib/scheduler/examples/usage-with-factory.ts` (3 instances)

These should be updated to use `createTaskForAgent` instead.

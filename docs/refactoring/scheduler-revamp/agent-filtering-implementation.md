# Agent ID Filtering Implementation Plan

## Completed Implementation

✅ Enhanced `TaskFilter` interface to support nested metadata filtering for agent IDs
✅ Added agent-specific methods to `ModularSchedulerManager`:
   - `findTasksForAgent(agentId, filter)`
   - `createTaskForAgent(task, agentId)`
   - `executeDueTasksForAgent(agentId)`
✅ Updated `MemoryTaskRegistry` to support nested object filtering in metadata
✅ Created factory function `createSchedulerManagerForAgent` for agent-specific schedulers
✅ Implemented comprehensive tests for agent ID filtering
✅ Created migration guide with emphasis on using `createTaskForAgent`

## Next Steps

1. **Audit Existing Code (CRITICAL)**
   - [ ] Review all task creation code to ensure `createTaskForAgent` is used instead of `createTask`
   - [ ] Add static code analysis rules to enforce usage of `createTaskForAgent`
   - [ ] Update all task queries to use agent-specific filtering where appropriate
   - [ ] Identify any places where tasks might be executed without agent filtering

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - [ ] Update API documentation to include agent-specific methods
   - [ ] Create usage examples for agent-specific schedulers
   - [ ] Document the agent ID metadata structure
   - [ ] Add warnings in `createTask` documentation to use `createTaskForAgent` instead

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Consider indexing agent IDs in the task registry for faster filtering
   - [ ] Benchmark agent filtering performance with large task sets
   - [ ] Optimize nested metadata filtering logic

4. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Add support for agent groups (tasks that can be executed by multiple agents)
   - [ ] Implement agent capabilities (tasks that require specific agent capabilities)
   - [ ] Add agent status tracking (active, idle, busy)

## Migration Guide

To migrate existing code to use agent ID filtering:

### CRITICAL: Always Use createTaskForAgent

```typescript
// INCORRECT - Don't use this pattern
const task = await scheduler.createTask({
  name: 'My Task',
  // other task properties
});

// CORRECT - Always use this pattern
const task = await scheduler.createTaskForAgent({
  name: 'My Task',
  // other task properties
}, 'agent-id');
```

### Option 1: Use Agent-Specific Methods

```typescript
// Before
const tasks = await scheduler.findTasks({
  metadata: {
    agentId: {
      id: 'agent-123'
    }
  }
});

// After
const tasks = await scheduler.findTasksForAgent('agent-123');
```

### Option 2: Use Agent-Specific Scheduler

```typescript
// Before
const scheduler = await createSchedulerManager(config);
// ... manually filter tasks by agent ID ...

// After
const agentScheduler = await createSchedulerManagerForAgent(config, 'agent-123');
// All operations automatically filtered by agent ID
```

## Testing Strategy

The implementation has been tested with the following scenarios:

1. Creating tasks with agent ID through agent-specific methods
2. Finding tasks for specific agents using `findTasksForAgent`
3. Executing tasks for specific agents using `executeDueTasksForAgent`
4. Verifying that agent IDs are properly added to tasks
5. Ensuring tasks are only executed by their assigned agents

## Migration Validation

To verify successful migration:

1. Run a query to find any tasks without proper agent IDs:
   ```typescript
   const tasksWithoutAgentId = await scheduler.findTasks({
     metadata: {
       agentId: null
     }
   });
   ```

2. Add runtime checks to warn about missing agent IDs:
   ```typescript
   if (!task.metadata?.agentId?.id) {
     console.warn('Task created without agent ID');
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The agent ID filtering implementation provides a robust foundation for multi-agent systems using the scheduler. It ensures that tasks are properly assigned to agents and that agents only execute their own tasks. 

**CRITICAL**: Always use `createTaskForAgent` instead of `createTask` to ensure proper agent ID assignment. This is essential for the correct functioning of agent-specific task filtering and execution.

Future work should focus on optimizing performance, adding more advanced agent capabilities, and ensuring all task creation code properly sets agent IDs.

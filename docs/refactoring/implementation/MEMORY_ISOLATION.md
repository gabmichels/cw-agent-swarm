# Memory Isolation System

## Overview

The Memory Isolation System provides secure and controlled access to memory across agent boundaries. It implements a fine-grained permission model and memory scoping to ensure each agent can only access memories it has been explicitly granted access to.

## Key Components

### 1. Memory Scope

A memory scope defines a boundary for a set of memories with consistent access controls. Scopes have three access levels:

- **Private** - Only accessible by the owner agent
- **Shared** - Accessible by the owner and explicitly granted agents
- **Public** - Accessible by all agents with default permissions

### 2. Memory Access Controls

The system implements a permission-based model with five distinct permission types:

- **Read** - Ability to read memories within a scope
- **Write** - Ability to create new memories within a scope
- **Update** - Ability to modify existing memories within a scope
- **Delete** - Ability to remove memories from a scope
- **Share** - Ability to grant access to other agents

### 3. Memory Sharing

Memories can be shared through an explicit request-response protocol:

1. An agent creates a sharing request specifying target agent and permissions
2. The target agent receives notification of the sharing request
3. The target agent can approve or deny the request
4. If approved, the specified permissions are granted

## Implementation Details

### Memory Isolation Manager

The `MemoryIsolationManager` is the core component responsible for enforcing isolation boundaries:

```typescript
export class MemoryIsolationManager {
  // Create memory scopes
  createScope(options: MemoryScopeCreationOptions): MemoryScope;

  // Check access permissions
  checkAccess(agentId: string, scopeId: string, permission: MemoryPermission): MemoryAccessResult<boolean>;

  // Handle memory sharing
  createSharingRequest(requestingAgentId: string, targetAgentId: string, scopeId: string, permissions: MemoryPermissionSet): MemorySharingRequest | null;
  respondToSharingRequest(requestId: string, approved: boolean, reason?: string): boolean;

  // Manage permissions
  revokePermissions(agentId: string, scopeId: string, permissions: MemoryPermissionSet): boolean;

  // Access information
  getScopesForAgent(agentId: string): MemoryScope[];
  getAgentsWithAccess(scopeId: string): string[];
  getAccessMetrics(): MemoryAccessMetrics;
}
```

### Agent Memory Manager

The `AgentMemoryManager` extends the capabilities of the isolation manager to provide a simpler interface for agents:

```typescript
export class AgentMemoryManager extends AbstractBaseManager implements MemoryManager {
  // Memory operations
  async addMemory(content: string, metadata: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>;
  async searchMemories(query: string, options: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown[]>;
  async searchAllScopes(query: string, options: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown[]>;
  async getRecentMemories(limit: number, options: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown[]>;

  // Memory sharing
  async shareMemories(targetAgentId: string, options): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>;
  async respondToSharingRequest(requestId: string, approved: boolean, reason?: string): Promise<boolean>;
  async getPendingSharingRequests(): Promise<unknown[]>;
  async getAccessibleScopes(): Promise<unknown[]>;
}
```

## Access Control Flow

1. Agent requests access to a memory scope
2. System checks if agent has required permission
3. If permission exists, access is granted
4. If permission does not exist, access is denied
5. All access attempts are logged for security auditing

## Security Considerations

1. **Scope Isolation** - Memories are strictly contained within scopes with appropriate permissions
2. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Agents only receive minimal required permissions
3. **Access Logging** - All memory access attempts are tracked and can be audited
4. **Explicit Sharing** - Memory sharing requires explicit approval
5. **Granular Permissions** - Different operations require different permissions

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Access Checks** - Access checks use in-memory lookup tables for performance
2. **Scope Optimization** - Related memories are grouped in scopes for efficient access
3. **Permission Caching** - Common permission checks can be cached
4. **Batch Operations** - Multiple memories can be shared in a single operation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Role-Based Access Control** - Group permissions by roles for easier management
2. **Time-Limited Access** - Granting temporary access with expiration
3. **Delegation Chains** - Allow agents to delegate their permissions (with limits)
4. **Conditional Permissions** - Grant access based on contextual conditions
5. **Memory Segmentation** - Further subdivide scopes for more granular access

## Test Coverage

The following test scenarios have been implemented to ensure the system functions correctly:

1. Private scope creation and access control
2. Shared scope with explicit permissions
3. Public scope with default permissions
4. Memory sharing request flow
5. Permission revocation
6. Access metrics and monitoring
7. Scope enumeration and discovery

    - Fixed dotenv import by changing from default import to named import
    - Changed `import dotenv from 'dotenv'` to `import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'`

## Root Causes

1. **MemoryType Enum Mismatches**
   - Two different `MemoryType` enums existed in the codebase, causing inconsistencies
   - Some code was using the old enum from `config.ts` while other code was using the new enum from `config/types.ts`

2. **Missing Required Properties in Metadata**
   - The `BaseMetadataSchema` interface requires a `schemaVersion` property, which was missing in mock objects
   - Test files were using simplified metadata objects that didn't satisfy the interface requirements

3. **EnhancedMemoryService vs MemoryService Type Mismatches**
   - `EnhancedMemoryService` is used where `MemoryService` was previously used
   - Many test files were still using `MemoryService` where `EnhancedMemoryService` is expected

4. **Task-Specific Metadata Fields**
   - Different memory types require specific metadata fields
   - Mock objects in tests didn't include all required fields

5. **References to Non-existent Functions**
   - Some test files referenced functions that don't exist
   - These needed to be updated to check for existence of objects instead

6. **API Changes**
   - The `MemoryContext` interface was updated to use a groups-based structure
   - Tests were still expecting the old API structure with `memories` and `total` properties

7. **ImportanceLevel Enum Mismatches**
   - Two different `ImportanceLevel` enums existed in the codebase
   - One in `constants/memory.ts` (`MemoryImportanceLevel`) and another in `config/types.ts`
   - Created adapter functions to convert between these types when needed

8. **Untyped Metadata Access**
   - Many files accessed metadata properties without proper typing
   - Used 'any' type instead of specific interfaces

9. **Legacy Timestamp-based ID Generation**
   - Many components used timestamp-based IDs instead of ULID/UUID
   - This caused sorting and uniqueness issues

10. **Incorrect Import Paths**
    - Some files were importing from composite paths (`../config`) when they needed specific modules
    - This led to mismatches between expected exports and what was actually available

11. **Incompatible Import Types**
    - Some modules were using default imports for libraries that don't have default exports
    - For example, dotenv needs to be imported with `import * as dotenv` instead of `import dotenv`

12. **Test Framework Inconsistencies**
    - Some test files used `it()` while others used `test()` for defining test cases
    - This inconsistency led to TypeScript errors because the test framework expects functions to be defined consistently

## Fix Strategy

1. For the `MemoryType` enum inconsistency: 
   - Removed the duplicate enum in `config.ts`
   - Added re-export from `config/types.ts`
   - Updated imports to use the correct enum

2. For missing metadata properties:
   - Add `schemaVersion: '1.0.0'` to all mock metadata objects
   - Ensure all required fields in `BaseMetadataSchema` are provided

3. For EnhancedMemoryService vs MemoryService mismatches:
   - Create adapters that implement the EnhancedMemoryService interface
   - Add all methods and properties required by consuming classes

4. For type-specific metadata:
   - Create custom interfaces that extend BaseMetadataSchema
   - Add type-specific fields to these interfaces
   - Use type assertions when accessing specific fields

5. For API changes:
   - Update tests to check for the new structure (e.g., `groups` instead of `memories`)
   - Create appropriate mock objects that match the current API structure

6. For ImportanceLevel mismatches:
   - Use the correct ImportanceLevel enum from `config/types.ts` in server code
   - Add type conversion functions between numeric values and enum values
   - Create adapter functions to convert between different ImportanceLevel enums when needed

7. For untyped metadata access:
   - Define proper interfaces for metadata structures
   - Use type guards to safely access metadata properties
   - Replace 'any' types with specific interfaces

8. For legacy ID generation:
   - Replace timestamp-based IDs with ULID/UUID
   - Implement proper identifier interfaces

9. For incorrect import paths:
   - Update imports to target specific modules rather than relying on barrel files
   - Use explicit imports from their source modules to avoid ambiguity

10. For incompatible import types:
    - Check the library's export structure and use appropriate import syntax
    - Use named imports for libraries without default exports

11. For test framework inconsistencies:
    - Standardize on using `test()` for all test definitions
    - Update existing `it()` calls to use `test()` for consistency

## Next Steps

Now that we've made significant progress fixing the memory service files, the next areas to focus on are:

1. **Fix remaining unit test issues**:
   - Address the `search-service.test.ts` with 10 remaining errors

2. **Fix the core service implementation files**:
   - Refactor the `search-service.ts` using interface-first design
   - Address type issues in factory test files

3. **Target high-error-count files in the Chloe agent system**:
   - Apply interface-first design to the scheduler with 15 errors
   - Refactor the scheduler components using dependency injection patterns

4. **Standardize type interfaces across components**:
   - Create shared interfaces for common patterns
   - Implement standardized error handling with proper types

The interface-first approach used in the cognitive-memory.ts, knowledge-graph.ts, and helpers.ts refactoring has proven effective at resolving multiple type issues while improving code quality. This pattern should be applied consistently across the codebase, especially when dealing with API changes and metadata structures. Creating adapter functions to handle type mismatches between different parts of the system has also been effective.

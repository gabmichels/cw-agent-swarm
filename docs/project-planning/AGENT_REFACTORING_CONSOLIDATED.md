# Consolidated Agent Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

Our agent architecture refactoring project aims to create a flexible, extensible framework that supports multiple agents with different capabilities, while decoupling from the Chloe-specific implementation. This consolidated plan merges multiple planning documents to create a coherent approach for implementation.

The core strategy leverages existing architecture components (`AgentBase`, `BaseManager`) to create a manager-based agent architecture with clear interfaces, type safety, and consistent patterns. This approach will allow us to support multiple agents with different capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

## Recent Progress (June 2024)

- **Interface Separation:**
  - Extracted `AgentBase` and `ManagersConfig` interfaces into their own files (`AgentBase.interface.ts`, `ManagersConfig.interface.ts`) for clarity and maintainability.
  - Renamed `AgentBase.ts` to `AbstractAgentBase.ts` to clearly distinguish the abstract class implementation from the interface.
- **Type Safety & Linting:**
  - All linter errors in base and shared agent code have been resolved.
  - All mock/test agents now fully implement the interface contract with no `any` types.
- **Testing:**
  - All tests in `src/agents/shared` (including base and capabilities) are passing, confirming the stability of the refactor and interface separation.
- **Documentation:**
  - Tracker and design documentation updated to reflect new file structure and interface-first approach.

### Code Modularization and Testing Plan (New Priority)

Several manager implementations have grown too large and need to be broken down into smaller, more focused components. This refactoring will improve maintainability, testability, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.

#### Tasks and Progress Tracker

| Task | Status | Progress |
|------|--------|----------|
| Standardize manager registration and initialization | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Improve type-safety of manager interactions | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Add manager lifecycle management (init/shutdown) | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Delegate core functionality to managers (memory, planning) | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| **Interface separation & file renaming** | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| **Implement manager-first approach to core functionality** | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| **Configuration System Standardization** | 🟡 In Progress | 0% |

| Implement simple agent memory routing | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |

#### Implementation Insights (Updated)
- Interface-first design and file separation greatly improve maintainability and clarity.
- Abstract class (`AbstractAgentBase`) now only contains implementation logic, while interfaces are reusable and importable across the codebase.
- All tests passing after a major refactor is a strong indicator of architectural stability.
- Manager-first delegation is now fully implemented for all core manager types (Memory, Planning, Tool, Knowledge, Scheduler) providing a clean, consistent API for agent implementations.
- Each delegation method follows the same pattern: retrieve manager, check initialization, delegate the call, ensuring consistent error handling across the codebase.

#### Current Implementation Step
- **Implementing Configuration System Standardization for all manager types.**
  - Define structured schema interfaces for each manager configuration
  - Create validation logic for configuration with type-safety
  - Implement configuration inheritance and defaulting
  - Add runtime validation for configuration values
  - Create configuration presets for common agent types
  - Add comprehensive test coverage for configuration handling
  - Document configuration system design and usage patterns

   - ⏳ Define structured configuration schemas for each manager type
   - ⏳ Implement configuration validation
   - ⏳ Add support for manager presets based on agent role/capabilities
   - ⏳ Create configuration inheritance system

### Phase 5: Agent Registration Flow Enhancement (⏳ Not Started)

   - ⏳ Add UI support for manager configuration
   - ⏳ Implement template-based agent creation
   - ⏳ Create preset configurations for common agent types
   - ⏳ Add validation to ensure consistent agent configuration

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation (⏳ Not Started)

1. ⏳ Develop essential test suite:
   - ⏳ Unit tests for core memory operations
   - ⏳ Basic integration tests for agent memory isolation
   - ⏳ Simple performance tests for memory loading
   - ⏳ Basic UI tests for MemoryTab
   - ⏳ **Note:** Backward compatibility with legacy code is **not required** and should not be a goal, per implementation guidelines. All tests should target the new architecture only.

## Key Implementation Details

### ChloeAgent Integration

The refactoring will make ChloeAgent extend the enhanced AgentBase:

```typescript
// After refactoring
export class ChloeAgent extends AgentBase {
  constructor(options: ChloeAgentOptions = {}) {
    super({
      agentId: 'chloe',
      config: {
        // Enable all the managers Chloe currently uses
        enableMemoryManager: true,
        enablePlanningManager: true,
        enableKnowledgeManager: true,
        // Chloe-specific configurations
        department: 'marketing',
        role: 'cmo',
        // ...other Chloe-specific settings
        ...options.config
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Chloe-specific methods that aren't in AgentBase
}
```

### Scheduler Refactoring

The scheduler refactoring will create an agent-agnostic implementation:

```typescript
export class AgentScheduler {
  private agent: BaseAgent;
  private tasks: AgentTask[];
  
  constructor(agent: BaseAgent, options: SchedulerOptions = {}) {
    this.agent = agent;
    this.tasks = options.tasks || [];
    
    // Register this scheduler
    SchedulerRegistry.registerScheduler(agent.getAgentId(), this);
  }
  
  // Methods for task scheduling, execution, etc.
}
```

### Task Template System

The refactoring will implement a capability-based task template system:

```typescript
export function getTasksForCapabilities(capabilities: string[]): AgentScheduledTask[] {
  const tasks: AgentScheduledTask[] = [];
  
  // Add core tasks every agent should have
  tasks.push({
    id: 'memory-consolidation',
    name: 'Memory Consolidation',
    description: 'Consolidate memories and reinforce important connections',
    schedule: '0 2 * * *', // 2 AM every day
    goalPrompt: 'Consolidate memories and reinforce important connections',
    tags: ['memory', 'maintenance']
  });
  
  // Add capability-specific tasks
  if (capabilities.includes('marketing')) {
    tasks.push(...TASK_TEMPLATES.MARKETING);
  }
  
  if (capabilities.includes('research')) {
    tasks.push(...TASK_TEMPLATES.RESEARCH);
  }
  
  // Return all matched tasks
  return tasks;
}
```

### Agent Registration Form Enhancement

The registration form will be enhanced to support the manager-based architecture:

```tsx
const ManagerConfiguration = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Manager Configuration</h2>
      
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Memory Manager</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Remembers conversations and important information</p>
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center">
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              id="enableMemoryManager"
              name="config.enableMemoryManager"
              checked={formData.config.enableMemoryManager}
              onChange={handleChange}
              className="mr-2"
            />
            <label htmlFor="enableMemoryManager">Enable</label>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        {/* Configuration options for enabled manager */}
        {formData.config.enableMemoryManager && (
          <div className="ml-6 mt-2 space-y-3">
            {/* Memory manager specific options */}
          </div>
        )}
        
        {/* Similar sections for other managers */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### MemoryTab Integration

The MemoryTab will be enhanced to support agent-scoped views:

```typescript
interface MemoryTabProps {
  // Existing props
  isLoadingMemories?: boolean;
  allMemories?: ExtendedMemoryItem[];
  onRefresh?: () => void;
  
  // New props for agent support
  selectedAgentId?: string;
  availableAgents?: string[];
  onAgentChange?: (agentId: string) => void;
  showAllMemories?: boolean;
  onViewChange?: (showAll: boolean) => void;
}

// MemoryTab component will use MemoryRouter for proper isolation
const MemoryTab: React.FC<MemoryTabProps> = ({
  selectedAgentId,
  availableAgents = [],
  onAgentChange,
  showAllMemories = false,
  onViewChange,
  // ... existing props
}) => {
  // Use MemoryRouter for agent-scoped access
  const { getAgentMemories, getAllMemories } = useMemoryRouter();
  
  // Load memories based on view mode
  const loadMemories = useCallback(async () => {
    if (showAllMemories) {
      return getAllMemories();
    }
    return selectedAgentId ? getAgentMemories(selectedAgentId) : [];
  }, [showAllMemories, selectedAgentId]);
  
  // ... rest of implementation
};
```

### Agent Memory Isolation

The memory system will use the existing MemoryRouter for proper isolation:

```typescript
// MemoryRouter already supports this
export class MemoryRouter {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  /**
   * Get memories for a specific agent
   */
  async getAgentMemories(agentId: string): Promise<MemoryEntry[]> {
    const scopes = this.getAccessibleScopes(agentId);
    return this.getMemoriesByScopes(scopes);
  }
  
  /**
   * Get all memories (when needed)
   */
  async getAllMemories(): Promise<MemoryEntry[]> {
    if (!this.options.enableSharedMemory) {
      throw new Error('Shared memory access is disabled');
    }
    return this.getMemoriesByScopes([this.options.defaultNamespace]);
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Principles

1. **INTERFACE-FIRST DESIGN**: Define interfaces before implementing classes
2. **STRICT TYPE SAFETY**: Never use 'any' type in TypeScript; create proper interfaces for all data structures
3. **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
4. **IMMUTABLE DATA**: Use immutable data patterns whenever possible
5. **ERROR HANDLING**: Use proper error handling with custom error types

### Manager Implementation Principles

1. Each manager should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. Managers should expose a consistent interface pattern
3. All managers should support proper lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown)
4. Configuration should drive manager behavior
5. Error handling should be consistent and comprehensive

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each manager in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between managers and the agent
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify existing code continues to function
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure no performance regressions
5. **UI Testing**: Verify the registration form and agent interactions

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Manager-First Delegation**
   - Refactor `AbstractAgentBase` to delegate additional core functions (e.g., tool management, knowledge, scheduling) to their respective managers using the same type-safe pattern.
   - Ensure all new delegations are covered by unit and integration tests.

2. **Configuration System Standardization**
   - Define and implement structured configuration schemas for each manager type.
   - Add validation and defaulting logic for manager configs.
   - Update documentation and add tests for configuration handling.

3. **Expand Integration Testing**
   - Add/expand integration tests for manager interactions and agent lifecycle.
   - Add error handling and edge case tests for all new delegation logic.

4. **Documentation & Architecture Diagrams**
   - Update architecture diagrams and documentation to reflect the new interface/class separation and manager-first delegation pattern.
   - Document lessons learned and best practices for future contributors.

---

**Summary:**
- The agent base and manager system are now robust, type-safe, and fully tested after a major refactor and interface separation.
- The next phase is to deepen the manager-first approach, standardize configuration, and expand integration testing and documentation.

# Consolidated Agent Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

Our agent architecture refactoring project aims to create a flexible, extensible framework that supports multiple agents with different capabilities, while decoupling from the Chloe-specific implementation. This consolidated plan merges multiple planning documents to create a coherent approach for implementation.

The core strategy leverages existing architecture components (`AgentBase`, `BaseManager`) to create a manager-based agent architecture with clear interfaces, type safety, and consistent patterns. This approach will allow us to support multiple agents with different capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

### Recent Progress

We have completed all manager interfaces and the first concrete implementation, `DefaultToolManager`, which follows the interface-first approach defined in our implementation guidelines. The `DefaultToolManager` implementation demonstrates key architecture patterns including:

- Strict type safety with no use of `any` types
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Efficient data structures with Map-based storage
- Proper lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown)
- Clean separation of interface and implementation

The insights from this implementation have been documented in `docs/implementation/MANAGER_IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md` to guide future development work.

## Key Implementation Details

### ChloeAgent Integration

The refactoring will make ChloeAgent extend the enhanced AgentBase:

```typescript
// After refactoring
export class ChloeAgent extends AgentBase {
  constructor(options: ChloeAgentOptions = {}) {
    super({
      agentId: 'chloe',
      config: {
        // Enable all the managers Chloe currently uses
        enableMemoryManager: true,
        enablePlanningManager: true,
        enableKnowledgeManager: true,
        // Chloe-specific configurations
        department: 'marketing',
        role: 'cmo',
        // ...other Chloe-specific settings
        ...options.config
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Chloe-specific methods that aren't in AgentBase
}
```

### Scheduler Refactoring

The scheduler refactoring will create an agent-agnostic implementation:

```typescript
export class AgentScheduler {
  private agent: BaseAgent;
  private tasks: AgentTask[];
  
  constructor(agent: BaseAgent, options: SchedulerOptions = {}) {
    this.agent = agent;
    this.tasks = options.tasks || [];
    
    // Register this scheduler
    SchedulerRegistry.registerScheduler(agent.getAgentId(), this);
  }
  
  // Methods for task scheduling, execution, etc.
}
```

### Task Template System

The refactoring will implement a capability-based task template system:

```typescript
export function getTasksForCapabilities(capabilities: string[]): AgentScheduledTask[] {
  const tasks: AgentScheduledTask[] = [];
  
  // Add core tasks every agent should have
  tasks.push({
    id: 'memory-consolidation',
    name: 'Memory Consolidation',
    description: 'Consolidate memories and reinforce important connections',
    schedule: '0 2 * * *', // 2 AM every day
    goalPrompt: 'Consolidate memories and reinforce important connections',
    tags: ['memory', 'maintenance']
  });
  
  // Add capability-specific tasks
  if (capabilities.includes('marketing')) {
    tasks.push(...TASK_TEMPLATES.MARKETING);
  }
  
  if (capabilities.includes('research')) {
    tasks.push(...TASK_TEMPLATES.RESEARCH);
  }
  
  // Return all matched tasks
  return tasks;
}
```

### Agent Registration Form Enhancement

The registration form will be enhanced to support the manager-based architecture:

```tsx
const ManagerConfiguration = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Manager Configuration</h2>
      
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Memory Manager</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Remembers conversations and important information</p>
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center">
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              id="enableMemoryManager"
              name="config.enableMemoryManager"
              checked={formData.config.enableMemoryManager}
              onChange={handleChange}
              className="mr-2"
            />
            <label htmlFor="enableMemoryManager">Enable</label>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        {/* Configuration options for enabled manager */}
        {formData.config.enableMemoryManager && (
          <div className="ml-6 mt-2 space-y-3">
            {/* Memory manager specific options */}
          </div>
        )}
        
        {/* Similar sections for other managers */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Principles

1. **INTERFACE-FIRST DESIGN**: Define interfaces before implementing classes
2. **STRICT TYPE SAFETY**: Never use 'any' type in TypeScript; create proper interfaces for all data structures
3. **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
4. **IMMUTABLE DATA**: Use immutable data patterns whenever possible
5. **ERROR HANDLING**: Use proper error handling with custom error types

### Manager Implementation Principles

1. Each manager should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. Managers should expose a consistent interface pattern
3. All managers should support proper lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown)
4. Configuration should drive manager behavior
5. Error handling should be consistent and comprehensive

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each manager in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between managers and the agent
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify existing code continues to function
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure no performance regressions
5. **UI Testing**: Verify the registration form and agent interactions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement DefaultToolManager
2. ✅ Implement DefaultMemoryManager
3. ✅ Implement DefaultPlanningManager
4. ✅ Implement DefaultSchedulerManager
5. Implement DefaultKnowledgeManager
6. Begin testing and validation phase
7. Continue implementation migration

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Modular Architecture**: Easily add or remove capabilities through managers
2. **Type Safety**: Improved reliability through strong TypeScript interfaces
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each manager handles a specific aspect of agent behavior
4. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple agents with different configurations
5. **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns make the code easier to understand and maintain
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities through additional managers

## Comparison: Original Chloe Implementation vs New Agent Base

### Original Chloe Implementation (`src/agents/chloe/`)

The original Chloe implementation serves as our reference implementation and remains untouched in the `src/agents/chloe` directory. Key aspects include:

1. **Core Structure**
   - Located in `src/agents/chloe/core/agent.ts`
   - Extends `AbstractAgentBase` but maintains Chloe-specific implementation
   - Uses a manager-based architecture with specialized managers:
     - `PlanningManager`
     - `MemoryManager`
     - `ToolManager`

2. **Compatibility Layer**
   - `src/agents/chloe/agent.ts` provides backward compatibility
   - Re-exports ChloeAgent and adds compatibility methods
   - Maintains existing API surface for dependent code

3. **Directory Organization**
   ```

### New Agent Base Architecture

The new architecture generalizes Chloe's patterns into a flexible, reusable framework:

1. **Core Components**
   - `AgentBase`: Core interface for all agents
   - `BaseManager`: Standardized manager interface
   - `ManagerAdapter`: Adapter pattern for manager integration
   - Specialized manager interfaces for each capability

2. **Key Improvements**
   - **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript interfaces with no `any` types
   - **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based dependency management
   - **Lifecycle Management**: Standardized initialization and shutdown
   - **Configuration System**: Structured configuration schemas
   - **Capability Management**: Clear capability registration and management

3. **Migration Path**
   - Original Chloe implementation remains as reference
   - New agents can extend `AgentBase` with specific configurations
   - Existing code can use compatibility layer
   - Gradual migration path for dependent systems

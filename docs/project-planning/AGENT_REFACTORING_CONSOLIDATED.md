# Consolidated Agent Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

Our agent architecture refactoring project aims to create a flexible, extensible framework that supports multiple agents with different capabilities, while decoupling from the Chloe-specific implementation. This consolidated plan merges multiple planning documents to create a coherent approach for implementation.

The core strategy leverages existing architecture components (`AgentBase`, `BaseManager`) to create a manager-based agent architecture with clear interfaces, type safety, and consistent patterns. This approach will allow us to support multiple agents with different capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

### Recent Progress

We have completed all manager interfaces and the first concrete implementation, `DefaultToolManager`, which follows the interface-first approach defined in our implementation guidelines. The `DefaultToolManager` implementation demonstrates key architecture patterns including:

- Strict type safety with no use of `any` types
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Efficient data structures with Map-based storage
- Proper lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown)
- Clean separation of interface and implementation

The insights from this implementation have been documented in `docs/implementation/MANAGER_IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md` to guide future development work.

### Code Modularization and Testing Plan (New Priority)

Several manager implementations have grown too large and need to be broken down into smaller, more focused components. This refactoring will improve maintainability, testability, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Key Implementation Details

### ChloeAgent Integration

The refactoring will make ChloeAgent extend the enhanced AgentBase:

```typescript
// After refactoring
export class ChloeAgent extends AgentBase {
  constructor(options: ChloeAgentOptions = {}) {
    super({
      agentId: 'chloe',
      config: {
        // Enable all the managers Chloe currently uses
        enableMemoryManager: true,
        enablePlanningManager: true,
        enableKnowledgeManager: true,
        // Chloe-specific configurations
        department: 'marketing',
        role: 'cmo',
        // ...other Chloe-specific settings
        ...options.config
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Chloe-specific methods that aren't in AgentBase
}
```

### Scheduler Refactoring

The scheduler refactoring will create an agent-agnostic implementation:

```typescript
export class AgentScheduler {
  private agent: BaseAgent;
  private tasks: AgentTask[];
  
  constructor(agent: BaseAgent, options: SchedulerOptions = {}) {
    this.agent = agent;
    this.tasks = options.tasks || [];
    
    // Register this scheduler
    SchedulerRegistry.registerScheduler(agent.getAgentId(), this);
  }
  
  // Methods for task scheduling, execution, etc.
}
```

### Task Template System

The refactoring will implement a capability-based task template system:

```typescript
export function getTasksForCapabilities(capabilities: string[]): AgentScheduledTask[] {
  const tasks: AgentScheduledTask[] = [];
  
  // Add core tasks every agent should have
  tasks.push({
    id: 'memory-consolidation',
    name: 'Memory Consolidation',
    description: 'Consolidate memories and reinforce important connections',
    schedule: '0 2 * * *', // 2 AM every day
    goalPrompt: 'Consolidate memories and reinforce important connections',
    tags: ['memory', 'maintenance']
  });
  
  // Add capability-specific tasks
  if (capabilities.includes('marketing')) {
    tasks.push(...TASK_TEMPLATES.MARKETING);
  }
  
  if (capabilities.includes('research')) {
    tasks.push(...TASK_TEMPLATES.RESEARCH);
  }
  
  // Return all matched tasks
  return tasks;
}
```

### Agent Registration Form Enhancement

The registration form will be enhanced to support the manager-based architecture:

```tsx
const ManagerConfiguration = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Manager Configuration</h2>
      
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Memory Manager</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Remembers conversations and important information</p>
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center">
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              id="enableMemoryManager"
              name="config.enableMemoryManager"
              checked={formData.config.enableMemoryManager}
              onChange={handleChange}
              className="mr-2"
            />
            <label htmlFor="enableMemoryManager">Enable</label>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        {/* Configuration options for enabled manager */}
        {formData.config.enableMemoryManager && (
          <div className="ml-6 mt-2 space-y-3">
            {/* Memory manager specific options */}
          </div>
        )}
        
        {/* Similar sections for other managers */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### MemoryTab Integration

The MemoryTab will be enhanced to support agent-scoped views:

```typescript
interface MemoryTabProps {
  // Existing props
  isLoadingMemories?: boolean;
  allMemories?: ExtendedMemoryItem[];
  onRefresh?: () => void;
  
  // New props for agent support
  selectedAgentId?: string;
  availableAgents?: string[];
  onAgentChange?: (agentId: string) => void;
  showAllMemories?: boolean;
  onViewChange?: (showAll: boolean) => void;
}

// MemoryTab component will use MemoryRouter for proper isolation
const MemoryTab: React.FC<MemoryTabProps> = ({
  selectedAgentId,
  availableAgents = [],
  onAgentChange,
  showAllMemories = false,
  onViewChange,
  // ... existing props
}) => {
  // Use MemoryRouter for agent-scoped access
  const { getAgentMemories, getAllMemories } = useMemoryRouter();
  
  // Load memories based on view mode
  const loadMemories = useCallback(async () => {
    if (showAllMemories) {
      return getAllMemories();
    }
    return selectedAgentId ? getAgentMemories(selectedAgentId) : [];
  }, [showAllMemories, selectedAgentId]);
  
  // ... rest of implementation
};
```

### Agent Memory Isolation

The memory system will use the existing MemoryRouter for proper isolation:

```typescript
// MemoryRouter already supports this
export class MemoryRouter {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  /**
   * Get memories for a specific agent
   */
  async getAgentMemories(agentId: string): Promise<MemoryEntry[]> {
    const scopes = this.getAccessibleScopes(agentId);
    return this.getMemoriesByScopes(scopes);
  }
  
  /**
   * Get all memories (when needed)
   */
  async getAllMemories(): Promise<MemoryEntry[]> {
    if (!this.options.enableSharedMemory) {
      throw new Error('Shared memory access is disabled');
    }
    return this.getMemoriesByScopes([this.options.defaultNamespace]);
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Principles

1. **INTERFACE-FIRST DESIGN**: Define interfaces before implementing classes
2. **STRICT TYPE SAFETY**: Never use 'any' type in TypeScript; create proper interfaces for all data structures
3. **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
4. **IMMUTABLE DATA**: Use immutable data patterns whenever possible
5. **ERROR HANDLING**: Use proper error handling with custom error types

### Manager Implementation Principles

1. Each manager should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. Managers should expose a consistent interface pattern
3. All managers should support proper lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown)
4. Configuration should drive manager behavior
5. Error handling should be consistent and comprehensive

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each manager in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between managers and the agent
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify existing code continues to function
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure no performance regressions
5. **UI Testing**: Verify the registration form and agent interactions

## Next Steps

1. Implement MemoryTab agent integration:
   - Add agent selector
   - Implement agent-scoped views
   - Add view mode toggle
   - Use MemoryRouter for proper isolation

2. Add basic performance optimizations:
   - Implement pagination
   - Add basic caching
   - Optimize memory loading
   - Improve filtering performance

3. Begin Core Cognitive Features:
   - Implement basic memory consolidation
   - Add simple relationship inference
   - Create basic memory decay system
   - Add simple insight generation

4. Begin testing phase:
   - Create basic test suite

   - Verify performance
   - Test UI components
   - Test cognitive features

5. Continue implementation migration:

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Modular Architecture**: Easily add or remove capabilities through managers
2. **Type Safety**: Improved reliability through strong TypeScript interfaces

## Comparison: Original Chloe Implementation vs New Agent Base

### Original Chloe Implementation (`src/agents/chloe/`)

The original Chloe implementation serves as our reference implementation and remains untouched in the `src/agents/chloe` directory. Key aspects include:

1. **Core Structure**
   - Located in `src/agents/chloe/core/agent.ts`
   - Extends `AbstractAgentBase` but maintains Chloe-specific implementation
   - Uses a manager-based architecture with specialized managers:
     - `PlanningManager`
     - `MemoryManager`
     - `ToolManager`

2. **Compatibility Layer**
   - `src/agents/chloe/agent.ts` provides backward compatibility
   - Re-exports ChloeAgent and adds compatibility methods
   - Maintains existing API surface for dependent code

3. **Directory Organization**
   ```

### New Agent Base Architecture

The new architecture generalizes Chloe's patterns into a flexible, reusable framework:

1. **Core Components**
   - `AgentBase`: Core interface for all agents
   - `BaseManager`: Standardized manager interface
   - `ManagerAdapter`: Adapter pattern for manager integration
   - Specialized manager interfaces for each capability

2. **Key Improvements**
   - **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript interfaces with no `any` types
   - **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based dependency management
   - **Lifecycle Management**: Standardized initialization and shutdown
   - **Configuration System**: Structured configuration schemas
   - **Capability Management**: Clear capability registration and management

3. **Migration Path**
   - Original Chloe implementation remains as reference
   - New agents can extend `AgentBase` with specific configurations
   - Existing code can use compatibility layer
   - Gradual migration path for dependent systems

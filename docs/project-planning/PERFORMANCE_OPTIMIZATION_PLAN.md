### Phase 4: Focused Iteration and Real-World Feedback

**Goal:** Use the agent in real scenarios, refine the operation queue as needed, and avoid overengineering.

### Tasks
- [ ] Use the agent in real scenarios and gather feedback on operation queue and system performance.
- [ ] Refine the operation queue based on real usage (fix bugs, improve reliability, tweak priorities/rate limits as needed).
- [ ] Only revisit monitoring and performance tuning if actual issues are encountered during real-world use.
- [ ] Update documentation as features or usage change, or as needed for clarity.

### Notes
- Previous phases (operation types, queue implementation, monitoring, and tests) are **completed**.
- Further improvements will be based on actual agent usage and feedback, not speculative optimization.
- This approach avoids overengineering and keeps the system agile for future needs.

# Memory System Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy for the memory system. The plan focuses on three main areas: caching, query optimization, and memory operations optimization.

## Current Performance Metrics

Based on performance tests (`memory-performance.test.ts`), we measure:
- Memory addition performance (individual vs batch)

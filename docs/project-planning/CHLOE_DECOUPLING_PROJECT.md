# Chloe Decoupling Project: Making Agent Architecture Generic

## Project Overview

This project aims to decouple the "Chloe" agent from our codebase to create a generic agent architecture. Currently, many agent capabilities and configurations are hardcoded specifically for Chloe, which prevents us from easily creating new agents with different configurations. The goal is to ensure that 100% of Chloe's functionality can be recreated through our `AgentRegistrationForm` without any hardcoded dependencies.

## Project Status

| Phase | Status | Timeline | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1. Audit of Hardcoded Elements | âœ… Completed | Week 1 | High |
| 2. Agent Initialization Refactoring | âœ… Completed | Week 2 | High |
| 3. Knowledge System Refactoring | âœ… Completed | Week 2-3 | High |
| 4. Capability Configuration | ðŸ”„ In Progress (25%) | Week 3 | Medium |
| 5. UI Registration Flow Enhancement | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Week 4 | Medium |
| 6. Testing & Validation | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Week 4-5 | High |

**Overall Progress:** 65% - Phase 1, 2, and 3 complete, Phase 4 started (2/4 tasks in Phase 3 completed, progressing on the 3rd task).

## Executive Summary

The current implementation of our agent system is tightly coupled to a specific agent named "Chloe". This creates several challenges:

1. New agents cannot leverage Chloe's capabilities without code duplication
2. Agent-specific data (like markdown knowledge) is hardcoded into file paths
3. System prompts, capabilities, and configuration are not dynamic
4. The singleton pattern for Chloe prevents proper multi-agent support

This project will refactor our agent architecture to use a generic, configurable design that separates agent-specific data from the underlying implementation. The end goal is to create a flexible system where any agent (including Chloe) can be fully configured through the `AgentRegistrationForm` UI.

## Audit of Hardcoded Elements

### Agent Identifiers

- Agent ID hardcoded as `"chloe"` in multiple places
- Global singleton references to `chloeAgent` in the global scope
- Direct imports from `agents/chloe` throughout the application

### Knowledge System

- Hardcoded markdown file paths in `data/knowledge/agents/chloe`
- Department hardcoded as `"marketing"` in the MarkdownManager
- Hardcoded knowledge directories in the agent initialization process

### System Prompts

- Hardcoded system prompt in `SYSTEM_PROMPTS.CHLOE` constant
- No dynamic prompt templates that can be customized per agent

### Capabilities

- Fixed set of capabilities in the agent implementation
- Hardcoded capability configurations in various managers

### Specialized Components

- `ChloeAgent` class with non-generic implementation
- Specialized managers like `MemoryManager` designed specifically for Chloe
- Singleton pattern for agent initialization in `getGlobalChloeAgent()`

#### Capability System Implementation

The capability system defines what agents can do, what roles they can fulfill, and what knowledge domains they specialize in. We've implemented this system with the following components:

1. **Capability Types**:
   - Skills: Technical abilities (e.g., marketing_strategy, data_analysis)
   - Roles: Functional roles (e.g., cmo, researcher)
   - Domains: Knowledge areas (e.g., marketing, finance)
   - Tags: General categorization

2. **Proficiency Levels**:
   - Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert levels
   - Used to indicate how skilled an agent is in a particular capability

3. **Central Registry**:
   - Singleton registry for capability registration and discovery
   - Enables dynamic agent selection for tasks
   - Supports capability-based agent matching

4. **ID Standardization**:
   - Consistent ID format: `[type].[name]` (e.g., `skill.marketing_strategy`)
   - Makes capabilities easily categorizable and discoverable

5. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Created generic capability system module with helper functions
   - Defined transitional Chloe-specific capabilities file
   - Standardized capability registration in agent initialization
   - Will be replaced by UI-driven configuration in future phase

### Phase 4: UI Registration Flow Enhancement

| Task | Scope | Priority | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Enhance AgentRegistrationForm | Add additional fields for all agent configurations | High | ðŸ”„ Not Started |

| Add system prompt editor | Implement editor for customizing system prompts | High | ðŸ”„ Not Started |
| Implement capability configuration table | Implement a four-column table layout for managing capabilities | Medium | ðŸ”„ Not Started |

#### AgentRegistrationForm Enhancements

The current `AgentRegistrationForm.tsx` lacks several critical fields needed to fully configure an agent. The following enhancements are needed:

1. **System Prompt Configuration**:
   - Add a rich text editor for creating/editing system prompts
   - Support for multiple system prompt templates
   - Preview functionality for system prompts

2. **Department Selection**:
   - Add a dropdown for department selection (Marketing, HR, Finance, etc.)
   - Allow custom department creation

3. **Knowledge Configuration**:
   - Add file upload functionality for markdown knowledge files
   - Directory structure visualization and management
   - Knowledge import from URLs or existing sources

4. **Advanced Parameters**:
   - Add sections for customInstructions
   - Add systemMessages array support
   - Add contextWindow configuration
   - Add tool permissions selection interface

5. **Agent Templates**:
   - Add a template selection dropdown
   - Provide preconfigured templates (including Chloe template)
   - Template preview functionality

6. **Capability Configuration Table**:
   - Implement a four-column table layout (Skills, Roles, Domains, Tags)
   - Each capability row contains name, description, and proficiency level selector
   - Add/remove controls for managing capabilities
   - Automatic capability ID generation using pattern `[type].[name]`
   - Preview section showing derived capability configuration
   - Capability template support to quickly populate from predefined sets

7. **Agent Relationships**:
   - Configure how the agent relates to other agents
   - Set up collaboration patterns

The form should include a comprehensive validation system to ensure all required fields are properly configured before agent creation.

## Key Changes Required

### 1. Refactor ChloeAgent to Extend AgentBase

```typescript
// BEFORE
export class ChloeAgent implements IAgent {
  readonly agentId: string = 'chloe';
  // ...
}

// AFTER
import { AgentBase } from '../../lib/agents/shared/base/AgentBase';

export class ChloeAgent extends AgentBase {
  constructor(options: AgentOptions) {
    super({
      config: {
        agentId: 'chloe',
        name: 'Chloe',
        description: 'CMO of Crowd Wisdom focused on marketing strategy',
        ...options.config
      },
      capabilityLevel: options.capabilityLevel || AgentCapabilityLevel.ADVANCED,
      toolPermissions: options.toolPermissions || []
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Make Knowledge Paths Dynamic

```typescript
// BEFORE
private getAgentDirectories(): string[] {
  return [
    'data/knowledge/company',
    `data/knowledge/agents/${this.agentId}`,
    'data/knowledge/agents/shared',
    `data/knowledge/domains/${this.department}`,
    'data/knowledge/test'
  ];
}

// AFTER
private getAgentDirectories(): string[] {
  // Reuse implementation from AgentBase or KnowledgeManager
  return this.getDefaultDirectories();
}
```

### 3. Make System Prompts Configurable

```typescript
// BEFORE
this.config = {
  systemPrompt: SYSTEM_PROMPTS.CHLOE,
  model: 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14',
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 4000,
  ...(options?.config || {}),
};

// AFTER
// Leverage the AgentBase config constructor
super({
  config: {
    systemPrompt: options?.config?.systemPrompt || SYSTEM_PROMPTS.CHLOE,
    model: options?.config?.model || process.env.DEFAULT_MODEL || 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14',
    temperature: options?.config?.temperature || 0.7,
    maxTokens: options?.config?.maxTokens || 4000,
    ...(options?.config || {})
  }
});
```

### 4. Replace Singleton Pattern

```typescript
// BEFORE
// Global instance (singleton)
let chloeInstance: ChloeAgent | null = null;

export async function getChloeInstance(): Promise<ChloeAgent> {
  if (chloeInstance) {
    return chloeInstance;
  }
  
  chloeInstance = new ChloeAgent();
  await chloeInstance.initialize();
  return chloeInstance;
}

// AFTER
// Use the existing AgentRegistry or adapt it
import { AgentRegistry } from '../../lib/agents/registry';

export async function getChloeInstance(): Promise<any> {
  return AgentRegistry.getAgent('chloe');
}
```

### 5. Update Manager Initialization

```typescript
// BEFORE
this.markdownManager = new MarkdownManager({
  memory: chloeMemory,
  agentId: this.agentId,
  department: 'marketing',
  logFunction: (message, data) => {
    this.taskLogger.logAction(`MarkdownManager: ${message}`, data);
  }
});

// AFTER
this.markdownManager = new MarkdownManager({
  memory: this.memory,
  agentId: this.agentId,
  department: this.config.department || 'marketing',
  knowledgePaths: this.config.knowledgePaths,
  logFunction: (message, data) => {
    this.taskLogger.logAction(`MarkdownManager: ${message}`, data);
  }
});
```

# Agent Relationship Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Agent Relationship Management system, which tracks and analyzes relationships between agents in the multi-agent system. This component enables relationship-aware collaboration, intelligent task delegation, and optimized agent pairing based on historical performance.

## Core Components

### Agent Relationship Service

The `AgentRelationshipService` provides a comprehensive API for tracking and analyzing agent-to-agent relationships. Key features include:

- Recording and updating relationships between agents
- Tracking interaction success rates and response times
- Calculating collaboration scores based on historical data
- Finding best collaborators for specific agents
- Identifying ideal agent pairs for complementary capabilities
- Generating relationship statistics for agents

### Data Model

The relationship data model includes:

```typescript
interface AgentRelationship {
  // Core identity
  id: string;
  agent1Id: string;
  agent2Id: string;
  
  // Relationship details
  relationshipType: RelationshipType;
  strength: number; // 0-100 score
  trustLevel: number; // 0-100 score
  description: string;
  
  // Interaction tracking
  interactionCount: number;
  successfulInteractions: number;
  lastInteraction: number; // timestamp
  averageResponseTime: number; // in milliseconds
  
  // Collaboration metrics
  collaborationScore: number; // 0-100 score
  taskCompletionRate: number; // 0-1 rate
  commonDomains: string[];
  complementaryCapabilities: {
    agent1Capability: string;
    agent2Capability: string;
    effectiveness: number; // 0-100 score
  }[];
  
  // Metadata
  establishedAt: number; // timestamp
  updatedAt: number; // timestamp
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Relationship Types

The system supports various relationship types:

```typescript
enum RelationshipType {
  COLLABORATION = 'collaboration',
  SUPERVISION = 'supervision',
  DELEGATION = 'delegation',
  COMPETITION = 'competition',
  CUSTOM = 'custom'
}
```

## Memory Integration

Agent relationships are stored in the memory system with:

- `AGENT_RELATIONSHIP` memory type for storing relationship data
- Optimized filter conditions for querying relationships
- Support for complex queries with multiple filter conditions
- Structured data format for tracking relationship evolution

## Usage Examples

### Recording a New Relationship

```typescript
import { getAgentRelationshipService } from 'src/server/memory/services/multi-agent/messaging';
import { RelationshipType } from 'src/agents/shared/capabilities/agent-relationship';

async function recordAgentInteraction(agent1Id: string, agent2Id: string, success: boolean) {
  const relationshipService = await getAgentRelationshipService();
  
  await relationshipService.recordRelationship(
    agent1Id,
    agent2Id,
    {
      relationshipType: RelationshipType.COLLABORATION,
      strength: 75,
      trustLevel: 80,
      successful: success,
      responseTime: 1200,
      agent1Capability: 'data_analysis',
      agent2Capability: 'machine_learning',
      capabilityEffectiveness: 85
    }
  );
}
```

### Finding Best Collaborators

```typescript
async function findSuitablePartners(agentId: string, limit: number = 3) {
  const relationshipService = await getAgentRelationshipService();
  
  const bestCollaborators = await relationshipService.findBestCollaborators(
    agentId,
    limit
  );
  
  return bestCollaborators.map(c => c.agentId);
}
```

### Finding Ideal Capability Pairs

```typescript
async function findBestTeamForTask(capability1: string, capability2: string) {
  const relationshipService = await getAgentRelationshipService();
  
  const bestPairs = await relationshipService.findIdealPairs(
    capability1,
    capability2,
    1
  );
  
  return bestPairs.length > 0 
    ? { agent1Id: bestPairs[0].agent1Id, agent2Id: bestPairs[0].agent2Id }
    : null;
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Relationship Quality Tracking**:
   - Automatically calculates relationship strength based on interaction history
   - Tracks success rates and response times
   - Computes collaboration scores for objective agent pairing

2. **Complementary Capability Analysis**:
   - Identifies which agents work well together for specific capability pairs
   - Tracks effectiveness scores for capability combinations
   - Enables data-driven team formation

3. **Domain-Based Analysis**:
   - Identifies common domains between agents
   - Tracks shared knowledge areas
   - Facilitates domain-specific collaborations

4. **Relationship Evolution**:
   - Tracks relationship changes over time
   - Automatically adjusts scores based on recent interactions
   - Provides trending information for relationships

## Integration Points

The Agent Relationship Service integrates with:

1. **Capability Registry**: To access agent capabilities for complementary pairing
2. **Conversation Manager**: To track agent interactions within conversations
3. **Message Router**: To optimize message routing based on relationship strength
4. **Memory System**: To store and retrieve relationship data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Relationship Visualization**: Create visual representations of agent networks
2. **Trust Mechanisms**: Implement more sophisticated trust models
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Add mechanisms for detecting and resolving agent conflicts
4. **Adaptive Teaming**: Implement dynamic team formation based on relationship data
5. **Performance-Based Routing**: Route messages based on relationship performance metrics

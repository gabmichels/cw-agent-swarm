# Multi-Agent System Implementation - Instruction Prompt

## Project Overview

This document serves as a detailed instruction prompt for implementing a comprehensive multi-agent system. The goal is to extend the existing architecture to support agent-to-agent communication, collaborative task solving, and flexible chat management. This project will build upon the existing UI for spawning agents and preliminary chat functionality already present in the codebase.

## Core Objectives

1. **Agent Data Model**: Implement a standardized agent data model with configuration, capabilities, and state management.
2. **Chat Infrastructure**: Create a robust chat system supporting multi-participant conversations with mixed agent and human participants.
3. **Message Routing**: Develop an intelligent message routing system that directs messages to appropriate agents based on context and capabilities.
4. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Enable direct and group communication between agents with structured protocols.
5. **Memory Integration**: Ensure all agent interactions are properly stored and retrievable through the memory system.
6. **UI Integration**: Connect the backend implementation with existing UI components for a seamless user experience.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation should follow these principles:

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build upon existing components wherever possible.
2. **Modular Design**: Create loosely coupled components with clean interfaces.
3. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing throughout the implementation to ensure consistency.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing systems while adding new functionality.
5. **Performance Consciousness**: Implement with consideration for message volume and memory usage.

## Priority Areas

### High Priority

1. **Core Data Models**: Implement Chat and Agent schemas with appropriate metadata structure.
2. **Memory Integration**: Create memory service wrappers for the new schemas.
3. **Message Routing**: Implement the basic message routing infrastructure.
4. **Chat Management**: Create chat creation, participant management, and persistence.

### Medium Priority

1. **Agent Discovery**: Implement mechanisms for agents to discover and query other agents.
2. **Protocol Standards**: Define standard communication protocols between agents.
3. **Conversation Context**: Maintain and share context across multi-agent conversations.
4. **Role-Based Permissions**: Implement permission systems for different agent roles.

### Low Priority

1. **Advanced Orchestration**: Implement sophisticated orchestration patterns for complex tasks.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize message delivery and processing for high-volume scenarios.
3. **Analytics**: Track and analyze inter-agent communication patterns.
4. **Extensibility**: Create plugin architecture for extending agent capabilities.

## Success Criteria

The multi-agent system implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Agents can be created, configured, and managed through a standardized interface
2. Agents can communicate with each other in both direct and group conversations
3. Conversations persist in memory and can be retrieved with proper context
4. Messages route correctly based on content, capabilities, and context
5. The system integrates seamlessly with the existing UI for agent spawning
6. Multiple agents can collaborate effectively on complex tasks

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation should be divided into three phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**:
   - Implement Agent and Chat data models
   - Create memory integration for new data types
   - Set up basic message routing infrastructure

2. **Communication Phase**:
   - Implement agent-to-agent communication protocols
   - Create conversation management functionality
   - Develop participant and permission systems

3. **Integration Phase**:
   - Connect with existing UI components
   - Implement real-time updates via WebSockets
   - Create monitoring and debugging tools

Each phase should be completed and thoroughly tested before moving to the next, with regular check-ins to ensure the project remains on track and aligned with overall system architecture.

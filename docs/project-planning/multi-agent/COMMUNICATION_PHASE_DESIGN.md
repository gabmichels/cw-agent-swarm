# Multi-Agent System Communication Phase Design

## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture, components, and design decisions for the Communication Phase of the multi-agent system. The Communication Phase implements the infrastructure required for agents to communicate effectively with each other, ensuring that messages are properly routed, transformed, and managed within conversations.

## Architecture Overview

The Communication Phase introduces several key components that work together to facilitate agent-to-agent communication:

1. **Message Router**: Responsible for routing messages between agents based on various strategies
2. **Message Transformer**: Handles format conversion and content enrichment for agent compatibility
3. **Conversation Manager**: Coordinates multi-agent conversations and manages participant interactions
4. **Capability Registry**: Enables capability-based discovery and routing for specialized agent functions

These components are built on top of the Foundation Phase's EnhancedMemoryService, leveraging its optimized performance characteristics for high-volume agent communications.

## Core Components

### Message Router

The Message Router implements the intelligent routing of messages between agents using several routing strategies:

- **Direct Routing**: Sends messages directly to specified recipients
- **Capability-based Routing**: Routes messages to agents with specific capabilities
- **Broadcast Routing**: Sends messages to all participants in a conversation
- **Load-balanced Routing**: Distributes messages based on agent workload and capacity
- **Contextual Routing**: Routes messages based on conversation context and history

Key design considerations:
- **Delivery Status Tracking**: Each message has a tracked delivery status
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Failed deliveries can be retried automatically
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects routing metrics for monitoring and optimization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed error reporting

### Message Transformer

The Message Transformer converts messages between different formats to ensure compatibility between agents with different capabilities and format preferences:

- **Format Conversion**: Transforms between TEXT, MARKDOWN, JSON, HTML, and STRUCTURED formats
- **Content Enrichment**: Adds context, history, capabilities, and knowledge information
- **Transformation Graph**: Defines supported transformation paths between formats
- **Metadata Preservation**: Optionally preserves metadata during transformations

Key design considerations:
- **Extensible Transformation Paths**: New transformation paths can be added easily
- **Contextual Enrichment**: Messages can be enriched with relevant context based on needs
- **Format Detection**: Smart detection of optimal transformation paths
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimizes unnecessary transformations

### Conversation Manager

The Conversation Manager coordinates multi-agent conversations and ensures appropriate participant interaction:

- **Participant Management**: Handles adding and removing participants from conversations
- **Message Submission**: Processes and routes new messages to appropriate recipients
- **Visibility Control**: Enforces message visibility rules within conversations
- **Flow Control**: Implements different conversation flow strategies (round-robin, free form, etc.)
- **State Management**: Tracks conversation states (initializing, active, paused, completed, failed)

Key design considerations:
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-volume, multi-agent conversations
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained control over who can see which messages
- **Dynamic Participation**: Participants can join and leave conversations
- **Notification System**: Built-in notifications for conversation events
- **Conversation History**: Complete and accessible conversation history

### Capability Registry

The Capability Registry enables capability-based discovery and routing, allowing agents to find other agents with specific capabilities:

- **Capability Registration**: Agents register their capabilities with level and proficiency
- **Capability Discovery**: Find agents that provide specific capabilities
- **Level-based Matching**: Match based on capability level requirements
- **Preferred Agents**: Support for specifying preferred agent providers
- **Capability Definitions**: Centralized capability definitions with parameters

Key design considerations:
- **Hierarchical Capabilities**: Capabilities can have dependencies on other capabilities
- **Versioning**: Support for capability versioning
- **Performance**: Optimized querying for rapid capability discovery
- **Extensibility**: Easy extension with new capability types

## Integration with Foundation Phase

The Communication Phase builds on the Foundation Phase's EnhancedMemoryService implementation:

1. **Optimized Queries**: Uses top-level fields for efficient query performance
2. **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Follows strict interface-first design principles
3. **Clean Break Approach**: Complete replacement of legacy patterns
4. **ULID/UUID**: Uses proper identifiers throughout

## Memory Types

The Communication Phase introduces several new memory types:

- **CONVERSATION**: Stores conversation metadata and state
- **AGENT**: Stores agent definitions and capabilities
- **AGENT_ACTIVITY**: Tracks agent activity for load balancing
- **TASK**: Represents tasks assigned to agents
- **AGENT_CAPABILITY**: Registers agent capabilities
- **CAPABILITY_DEFINITION**: Defines capability types and parameters

## Communication Flow

A typical message flow in the multi-agent system:

1. A message is submitted to the Conversation Manager
2. The Conversation Manager stores the message and determines recipients
3. For each recipient, the Message Transformer converts the message to their preferred format
4. The Message Router delivers the message to each recipient
5. Recipients process the message and may respond
6. Responses follow the same path back through the system

## Data Models

### Message Models

```typescript
export interface AgentMessage {
  id: string;
  senderId: string;
  recipientId?: string;
  chatId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: number;
  priority: MessagePriority;
  requiredCapabilities?: string[];
  routingStrategy: RoutingStrategy;
  context?: Record<string, unknown>;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  deliveryStatus: DeliveryStatus;
  traceId?: string;
}

export interface TransformableMessage {
  id: string;
  senderId: string;
  recipientId: string;
  content: string;
  format: MessageFormat;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  contextItems?: ContextItem[];
}
```

### Conversation Models

```typescript
export interface Conversation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  state: ConversationState;
  participants: Participant[];
  messages: ConversationMessage[];
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
  flowControl: FlowControlType;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface Participant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: ParticipantType;
  role: ParticipantRole;
  capabilities?: string[];
  joinedAt: number;
  lastActiveAt: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Capability Models

```typescript
export interface Capability {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: CapabilityType;
  parameters?: Record<string, unknown>;
  requiredCapabilities?: string[];
  incompatibleWith?: string[];
}

export interface AgentCapability {
  capabilityId: string;
  level: CapabilityLevel;
  parameters?: Record<string, unknown>;
  enabled: boolean;
  proficiency?: number;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

The Communication Phase components are designed with performance in mind:

1. **Efficient Querying**: Optimized filters and indices for common query patterns
2. **Parallel Processing**: Parallel delivery of messages to multiple recipients
3. **Minimal Transformations**: Only transform messages when necessary
4. **Batch Operations**: Batch database operations when possible
5. **Caching**: Strategic caching of capabilities and agent information
6. **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking asynchronous operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Message Visibility Control**: Fine-grained control over who can see messages
2. **Participant Authorization**: Checks for participant permissions before operations
3. **Capability Validation**: Validation of capabilities before registration
4. **Content Filtering**: Potential for content filtering or sanitization
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of communication activities

## Future Enhancements

The Communication Phase design allows for several future enhancements:

1. **Advanced AI Routing**: Using AI to determine optimal routing paths
2. **Semantic Capability Matching**: Matching capabilities based on semantic similarity
3. **Dynamic Flow Control**: Adaptive conversation flow based on conversation context
4. **Federated Communication**: Communication between agents across different systems
5. **Real-time Message Streaming**: Support for streaming messages in real-time
6. **Cryptographic Message Signing**: Message integrity and authentication

## Conclusion

The Communication Phase provides a robust and flexible foundation for agent-to-agent communication in the multi-agent system. By implementing the Message Router, Message Transformer, Conversation Manager, and Capability Registry, we enable sophisticated interactions between agents with different capabilities and format requirements.

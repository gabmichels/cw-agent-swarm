## Key Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Memory system refactoring | High | Align with memory refactoring to ensure compatibility with new metadata structure |
| Existing UI components | Medium | Work closely with UI team to ensure smooth integration |
| Performance implications | Medium | Implement performance testing early in development |

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Schema design complexity | Medium | High | Start with minimal viable data model and iterate |
| Message routing scalability | Medium | High | Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Regular sync meetings with UI and core teams |
| Security concerns | Low | High | Implement comprehensive security review before launch |

## Implementation Notes

### Agent Data Model Design

The Agent data model should include:
- Core properties (id, name, description)
- Capability definitions with version support
- Configuration parameters
- State tracking
- Relationship mapping to other agents

### Chat Infrastructure Design

The Chat infrastructure should support:
- Multiple conversation models (1:1, group, broadcast)
- Rich message types with metadata
- Conversation branching and merging
- Context preservation across turns
- Participant management with permissions

### Message Routing Considerations

For effective message routing:
- Implement capability-based routing
- Support priority levels for messages
- Include failure handling and retries
- Design for async communication patterns
- Consider load balancing for busy agents

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Agent and Chat data models
2. Implement memory integration for the new collections
3. Begin work on the message routing infrastructure
4. Schedule regular reviews to ensure alignment with overall system architecture

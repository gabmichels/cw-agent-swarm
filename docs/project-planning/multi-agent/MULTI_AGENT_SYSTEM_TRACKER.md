```typescript
/**

 * This implements the dual-field approach for improved query performance
 */
export interface EnhancedMemoryPoint<T extends BaseMemorySchema> extends MemoryPoint<T> {
  // Indexable fields for common queries - duplicated from metadata for performance
  userId?: string;       // From payload.metadata.userId
  agentId?: string;      // From payload.metadata.agentId
  chatId?: string;       // From payload.metadata.chatId

    agent_1_capability: string;
    agent_2_capability: string;
    effectiveness: number;
  }[];

  established_at: string;           // ISO timestamp when relationship was established
  updated_at: string;               // ISO timestamp of last update
}
```

These enhanced data models facilitate:

1. **Advanced Capability Management**:
   - Dynamic capability discovery and assignment
   - Performance tracking by capability
   - Confidence-based task delegation

2. **Relationship-Aware Collaboration**:
   - Smart task delegation based on past collaboration success
   - Team formation using strongest relationships
   - Early identification of ineffective agent pairings
   - Automatic task routing based on relationship strength

3. **System-Level Optimizations**:
   - Load balancing based on capability proficiency

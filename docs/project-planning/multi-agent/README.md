# Multi-Agent System Implementation Project

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the comprehensive multi-agent system implementation project aimed at enabling agent-to-agent communication, collaborative problem-solving, and flexible chat management. The system will build upon existing UI components for agent spawning and preliminary chat functionality to create a fully functional multi-agent ecosystem.

## Key Documents

- [**MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md**](./MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md) - Detailed instruction prompt outlining the goals, requirements, and implementation approach for the multi-agent system.
- [**MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_TRACKER.md**](./MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_TRACKER.md) - Comprehensive tracker documenting the project's progress, task status, and implementation details.

## Project Goals

1. **Enable Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Create a robust communication framework for agents to interact, delegate tasks, and share information.
2. **Implement Chat and Agent Data Models**: Develop standardized models for agents and chats with appropriate metadata structures.
3. **Create Memory Integration**: Ensure all agent interactions are properly stored and retrievable through the memory system.
4. **Develop Message Routing**: Build an intelligent message routing system that directs messages to appropriate agents.
5. **Connect with Existing UI**: Integrate the backend implementation with existing UI components for a seamless user experience.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into three phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Implementing the core data models and memory integration.
2. **Communication Phase**: Creating the communication protocols and message routing infrastructure.
3. **Integration Phase**: Connecting with UI components and optimizing for production.

## Getting Started

To contribute to this project:

1. Review the [MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md](./MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md) document to understand the goals and requirements.
2. Check the current status and assigned tasks in [MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_TRACKER.md](./MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_TRACKER.md).
3. Focus on implementing the high-priority items first, particularly the Agent and Chat data models.

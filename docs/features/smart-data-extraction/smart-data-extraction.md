# Smart Data Extraction System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
Enable users to automatically extract structured data from unstructured agent conversations and generate custom analytics, dashboards, and exports without hardcoding domain-specific logic.

### Problem Statement
Users accumulate valuable data through conversations with specialized agents (fitness coaches, accountants, CMOs, etc.) but have no way to:
- Extract structured insights from unstructured conversations
- Track progress over time with metrics and visualizations
- Export data to external tools (Google Sheets, dashboards)
- Generate analytics from their interaction history

### Solution Approach
Implement a **role-aware over-extraction system** that:
1. Uses agent system prompts to determine relevance context
2. Over-extracts data points during conversations
3. Stores data in flexible, unstructured format
4. Uses LLM-powered filtering for query-time analytics
5. Generates visualizations and exports on demand

---

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- **Zero Configuration**: No hardcoded domain knowledge or categories
- **High Flexibility**: Support any agent role and data type
- **Data Preservation**: Never lose potentially valuable information
- **Natural Queries**: Support complex analytical questions in plain English

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 70%+ of active agents use structured data extraction
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ user satisfaction with extracted data relevance
- **Usage**: Average 5+ analytical queries per user per week
- **Export Volume**: 50%+ of extracted data gets exported to external tools

### Anti-Goals
- Building domain-specific extraction rules
- Creating rigid data schemas
- Real-time processing requirements
- 100% extraction accuracy (over-extraction is preferred)

---

### 4.2 Data Flow

1. **Extraction Phase**: Agent responses include structured data markers
2. **Storage Phase**: Over-extracted data stored in flexible CSV/JSON format
3. **Query Phase**: User analytical queries trigger LLM-powered filtering
4. **Output Phase**: Generate visualizations, exports, or insights

### 4.3 Data Schema

```typescript
interface ExtractedDataPoint {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  agentRole: string;           // "fitness_coach", "accountant", "cmo"
  domain?: string;             // Auto-detected or manual
  entityType?: string;         // "exercise", "expense", "metric"
  value: any;                  // Flexible value storage
  unit?: string;               // "lbs", "USD", "hours", "%"
  description: string;         // Human-readable description
  confidence: number;          // 0-1 extraction confidence
  rawContext: string;          // Original conversation context
  userId: string;
  agentId: string;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

## 5. System Prompt Enhancement

### 5.1 Generic Enhancement Template

```
${originalSystemPrompt}

STRUCTURED DATA TRACKING:
When users mention any numbers, data points, or information relevant to your role that could be useful later, also return structured data.

Guidelines:
- Only extract factual information (not hypothetical or speculative)
- Focus on data actionable for your role
- Include context for future interpretation
- Use confidence scores (only extract if >80% confident)

Format:
STRUCTURED_DATA: {
  "domain": "auto_detected",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "detected_type",
      "value": extracted_value,
      "unit": "unit_if_applicable", 
      "description": "human_readable_description",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5.2 Role-Specific Behavior

- **Fitness Coach**: Extracts exercise metrics, body measurements, nutrition data
- **Accountant**: Extracts financial transactions, tax information, business metrics  
- **CMO**: Extracts campaign metrics, budget data, performance indicators

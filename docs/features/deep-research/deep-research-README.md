## Key Features

### Universal Research Methodology
- **Domain-Agnostic**: Adapts to any research domain (M&A, market research, competitive analysis, fraud detection)
- **Query-Driven**: Extracts research intent and focus areas from user queries
- **Recursive Investigation**: Follows promising leads through multiple investigation layers
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Searches web, news, social media, and documents simultaneously

### Progressive Knowledge Accumulation
- **Real-Time Storage**: Findings stored as discovered with semantic embeddings
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies and tracks key entities, relationships, and concepts
- **Finding Clustering**: Groups related findings to identify patterns and themes
- **Evidence Chains**: Builds logical chains of evidence supporting key insights

### Professional Report Generation
- **Executive Summaries**: High-level overview of key findings and insights
- **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis organized by themes and findings
- **Source Attribution**: Complete citation list with credibility assessment
- **Visual Elements**: Charts, graphs, and data visualizations where appropriate

## Technical Architecture

### Storage Strategy
- **Dedicated Collections**: `research_sessions`, `research_findings`, `research_reports`
- **ULID-Based Identification**: Each research session has unique identifier linking all materials
- **Session Isolation**: Complete isolation of research sessions for privacy and organization
- **Semantic Search**: Full semantic search across all research findings and reports

### Integration Points
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages current Qdrant, Knowledge Graph, LangGraph systems
- **Tool Integration**: Integrates with existing web search, scraping, and analysis tools
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Comprehensive fact-checking and source attribution
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-based progress updates during research sessions

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Compliance
- **ULID-Based IDs**: All entities use ULID identifiers for consistency
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any` types, comprehensive interface definitions
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection for all services
- **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementing classes
- **Immutable Data**: Use immutable data patterns where possible

### Testing Requirements
- **>95% Code Coverage**: All new components must achieve high test coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Test all business logic with isolated unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with real data sources
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete workflows from query to report generation

### Performance Standards
- **Research Duration**: 20-30 minutes for deep research, 5-10 minutes for shallow
- **Source Coverage**: 40-100 sources per deep research session
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support 5+ simultaneous research sessions
- **Real-Time Updates**: Progress updates every 30-60 seconds

## Getting Started

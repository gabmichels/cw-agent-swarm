# Deep Research System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Deep Research System transforms our agent platform into a comprehensive research engine capable of conducting 20-30 minute deep investigations similar to OpenAI Research or Perplexity Pro. Rather than creating role-specific research agents, we're building a **Universal Deep Research Engine** that adapts to any domain based on user queries through recursive investigation methodology.

## Problem Statement

Current limitations in research capabilities:
- **Shallow Investigation**: Single-pass web searches provide surface-level information
- **No Follow-up Investigation**: No recursive drilling down into promising leads
- **Manual Synthesis**: Users must manually connect findings across multiple sources
- **No Knowledge Persistence**: Research findings are not accumulated and connected
- **Limited Source Coverage**: Restricted to basic web search without comprehensive source exploration

## Solution Overview

### Universal Deep Research Engine
A domain-agnostic research system that:
1. **Analyzes user queries** to extract research intent and focus areas
2. **Conducts recursive investigation** following promising leads across multiple sources
3. **Accumulates knowledge progressively** building a comprehensive understanding
4. **Synthesizes findings** into professional, citable reports
5. **Persists research sessions** for future reference and cross-research insights

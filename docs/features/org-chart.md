# Organizational Chart Feature Implementation Plan

## Construction Prompt

**GOAL**: Implement an optional organizational chart system that allows visualization, planning, and management of agent departments and hierarchies, with capabilities to spawn agents from organizational templates and copy configurations. The system must gracefully support both organizational/company contexts and personal/individual use cases.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Follow all guidelines specified in `@IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md` including:
- REPLACE, DON'T EXTEND legacy patterns
- Use ULID for all identifiers  
- STRICT TYPE SAFETY - no 'any' types
- Test-driven development with >95% coverage
- Interface-first design with dependency injection
- No placeholder implementations - aim for full implementations
- Performance-conscious implementation

## Feature Overview

The Organizational Chart feature will provide:
1. **Visual Organization Structure** - Interactive org chart showing departments and agents (when organizational mode is enabled)
2. **Planning Mode** - Drag-and-drop interface for reorganizing structure
3. **Agent Configuration Templates** - Save and reuse agent configurations (available in both modes)
4. **Agent Spawning** - Launch new agents from templates with copied configurations (available in both modes)
5. **Department Management** - Create, modify, and manage organizational departments (organizational mode only)
6. **Flexible Platform Modes** - Support for both organizational/company and personal/individual contexts

## Platform Modes

### Personal Mode (`PLATFORM_MODE=personal`)
- No organizational features (departments, hierarchies, reporting)
- Agents are simply categorized by functionality/purpose (e.g., "Finance", "Health", "Productivity")
- Simple agent templates and spawning capabilities
- Flat agent structure focused on individual use cases

### Organizational Mode (`PLATFORM_MODE=organizational`)
- Full organizational chart with departments and hierarchies
- Reporting relationships and management structures
- Team-based agent management
- Company-focused categorization and workflows

## Technical Specifications

### Data Models

```typescript
interface AgentMetadata extends BaseMetadata {
  // Existing properties...
  
  // Universal properties (both modes)
  category?: string; // For personal mode: "Finance", "Health", "Productivity"
  
  // Organizational properties (organizational mode only)
  department?: string; // For organizational mode: actual departments
  subDepartment?: string; // Verticals/domains within department (e.g., "Drivers" within "Engineering")
  team?: string; // Small units/pods within subdepartment (e.g., "Backend Team" within "Drivers")
  position?: string;
  reportingTo?: StructuredId;
  managedAgents?: StructuredId[];
  organizationLevel?: number;
}

interface PlatformConfig {
  mode: 'personal' | 'organizational';
  organizationName?: string; // Only for organizational mode
  personalUserName?: string; // Only for personal mode
}

// Example organizational hierarchy structure:
// Company: Deliveroo
//   ├── Department: Engineering
//   │   ├── SubDepartment: Drivers
//   │   │   ├── Team: Backend Team
//   │   │   │   ├── Agent: API Developer
//   │   │   │   └── Agent: Database Specialist
//   │   │   └── Team: Mobile Team
//   │   │       └── Agent: iOS Developer
//   │   └── SubDepartment: Marketplace
//   │       └── Team: Recommendations Team
//   └── Department: Operations
//       └── SubDepartment: Customer Service

interface Department {
  id: StructuredId;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  parentDepartment?: StructuredId;
  headOfDepartment?: StructuredId;
  agents: StructuredId[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface OrganizationChart {
  id: StructuredId;
  name: string;

  capabilities: AgentCapability[];
  defaultDepartment?: string;
  defaultPosition?: string;
  configParams: Record<string, unknown>;

}
```

### Performance Requirements

- [x] **Phase 1 & 2 Completed**: Core services support both personal and organizational modes
- [x] **Phase 2 Completed**: Department management system with full CRUD operations
- [x] **Phase 2 Completed**: Agent templates can be created and used to spawn new agents (both modes)
- [x] **Phase 2 Completed**: Hierarchical organization structure with validation
- [x] **Phase 2 Completed**: High-performance query engine with caching
- [ ] Organizational mode: Full org chart displays correctly for existing agents (UI - Phase 3)
- [ ] Planning mode allows drag-and-drop reorganization (both modes) (UI - Phase 3)
- [ ] UI gracefully adapts to the selected platform mode (Phase 4)
- [x] **Phase 2 Completed**: All operations maintain data integrity across both modes
- [x] **Phase 2 Completed**: Performance meets specified requirements for backend services
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 95% (Phase 6)
- [ ] Full integration with existing dashboard and agent systems (Phase 5)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Legacy Data Migration**: Implement gradual migration with fallbacks for existing agents
2. **Performance at Scale**: Implement pagination and lazy loading for large agent counts
3. **UI Complexity**: Start with basic functionality, iterate based on feedback
4. **Integration Issues**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
5. **User Adoption**: Provide comprehensive onboarding and documentation
6. **Mode Confusion**: Clear indicators and documentation about platform mode capabilities
7. **Feature Creep**: Maintain clear separation between personal and organizational features

## Future Enhancements

- **Setup Wizard**: Replace environment variable with initial setup wizard
- **Client-Specific Settings**: Store platform mode preference per client/organization
- **Hybrid Mode**: Allow personal users to optionally enable some organizational features
- **Import/Export**: Migrate between personal and organizational modes

# Organizational Chart Feature Implementation Plan

## Construction Prompt

**GOAL**: Implement an optional organizational chart system that allows visualization, planning, and management of agent departments and hierarchies, with capabilities to spawn agents from organizational templates and copy configurations. The system must gracefully support both organizational/company contexts and personal/individual use cases.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Follow all guidelines specified in `@IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md` including:
- REPLACE, DON'T EXTEND legacy patterns
- Use ULID for all identifiers  
- STRICT TYPE SAFETY - no 'any' types
- Test-driven development with >95% coverage
- Interface-first design with dependency injection
- No placeholder implementations - aim for full implementations
- Performance-conscious implementation

---

## Feature Overview

The Organizational Chart feature will provide:
1. **Visual Organization Structure** - Interactive org chart showing departments and agents (when organizational mode is enabled)
2. **Planning Mode** - Drag-and-drop interface for reorganizing structure
3. **Agent Configuration Templates** - Save and reuse agent configurations (available in both modes)
4. **Agent Spawning** - Launch new agents from templates with copied configurations (available in both modes)
5. **Department Management** - Create, modify, and manage organizational departments (organizational mode only)
6. **Flexible Platform Modes** - Support for both organizational/company and personal/individual contexts

## Platform Modes

### Personal Mode (`PLATFORM_MODE=personal`)
- No organizational features (departments, hierarchies, reporting)
- Agents are simply categorized by functionality/purpose (e.g., "Finance", "Health", "Productivity")
- Simple agent templates and spawning capabilities
- Flat agent structure focused on individual use cases

### Organizational Mode (`PLATFORM_MODE=organizational`)
- Full organizational chart with departments and hierarchies
- Reporting relationships and management structures
- Team-based agent management
- Company-focused categorization and workflows

4. **Integration Issues**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
5. **User Adoption**: Provide comprehensive onboarding and documentation
6. **Mode Confusion**: Clear indicators and documentation about platform mode capabilities
7. **Feature Creep**: Maintain clear separation between personal and organizational features

## Future Enhancements

- **Client-Specific Settings**: Store platform mode preference per client/organization
- **Hybrid Mode**: Allow personal users to optionally enable some organizational features
- **Import/Export**: Migrate between personal and organizational modes

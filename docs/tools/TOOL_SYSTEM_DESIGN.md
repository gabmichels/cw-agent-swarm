# Tool System Design

## Overview

The Tool System provides a flexible, modular architecture for defining, managing, and executing tools with built-in fallback mechanisms. The system has been refactored from a monolithic `ToolFallbackManager` into a set of focused components with clear responsibilities, following the principles of interface-first design and the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Key Components

The Tool System is composed of the following key components:

### 1. ToolRegistry

The `ToolRegistry` is responsible for registering, storing, and retrieving tools. It provides a centralized repository of all available tools and supports:

- Registering individual or multiple tools
- Retrieving tools by ID
- Finding tools by criteria (category, enabled status, etc.)
- Removing tools

### 2. FallbackStrategy

The `FallbackStrategy` determines what alternative tools to try when a primary tool fails. It implements different strategies for fallback selection:

- **Sequential**: Try alternative tools in their original order
- **Similarity**: Try tools most similar to the failed tool
- **Performance**: Try tools with the highest historical success rates
- **None**: No fallbacks

The strategy component also tracks tool execution outcomes to improve future fallback decisions through learning.

### 3. ToolExecutor

The `ToolExecutor` handles the actual execution of tools, including:

- Argument validation against tool schemas
- Timeout handling
- Cancellation support
- Retry logic with configurable backoff
- Execution metrics collection

### 4. ToolFallbackOrchestrator

The `ToolFallbackOrchestrator` coordinates the other components, providing a high-level interface for tool execution with automatic fallback handling. It:

- Calls the appropriate tool from the registry
- Executes it using the executor
- Handles failures by finding and trying fallback tools
- Maintains execution history for analysis
- Provides statistics on tool performance

## Architecture

The architecture follows a dependency injection pattern, where the orchestrator depends on the three specialized components:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│  ToolFallbackOrchestrator │
│                         │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            │ composes
            ▼
┌───────────┬─────────────┬───────────┐
│           │             │           │
│ToolRegistry│FallbackStrategy│ToolExecutor│
│           │             │           │
└───────────┴─────────────┴───────────┘
```

Each component is defined by a clean interface:

- `IToolRegistry`
- `IFallbackStrategy`
- `IToolExecutor`
- `IToolFallbackOrchestrator`

This ensures loose coupling and allows for easy testing and potential replacement of individual components.

## Tool Model

Tools are represented by the `Tool` interface, which includes:

- **id**: Unique identifier
- **name**: Display name
- **description**: Description of what the tool does
- **category**: Category for grouping (SYSTEM, FILE, WEB, etc.)
- **enabled**: Whether the tool is available for use
- **execute**: Function that performs the tool's action
- **schema**: Optional schema for parameter validation
- **metadata**: Optional additional information

## Execution Flow

1. Client code requests a tool execution with arguments through the orchestrator
2. Orchestrator retrieves the tool from the registry
3. Orchestrator passes the tool and arguments to the executor
4. Executor validates arguments and executes the tool
5. If execution succeeds, the result is returned
6. If execution fails, the orchestrator asks the strategy for fallback tools
7. Orchestrator tries each fallback tool until one succeeds or all fail
8. Results and metrics are recorded for future optimization

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

- Tool-specific errors with standardized format
- Validation errors for invalid arguments
- Timeout errors for executions that take too long
- Execution errors with detailed context
- Enhanced error information for fallbacks (original tool, fallbacks attempted, etc.)

## Performance Considerations

- The executor supports timeouts to prevent long-running tools from blocking
- The strategy caches similarity calculations to improve performance
- The registry uses a `Map` for fast tool lookups by ID
- Fallbacks can be limited to prevent excessive execution attempts
- Execution metrics are tracked for performance analysis

## Statistics and Analytics

The system collects rich execution data, including:

- Success rates by tool
- Average execution duration
- Fallback frequency
- Historical execution results

This data can be used to analyze tool performance, identify problematic tools, and continually optimize the fallback strategy.

## Testing

Each component has comprehensive unit tests that verify its functionality in isolation. The tests use mocks for dependencies to ensure proper separation of concerns.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tool Execution

```typescript
// Create the components
const registry = new ToolRegistry();
const strategy = new FallbackStrategy();
const executor = new ToolExecutor();
const orchestrator = new ToolFallbackOrchestrator(registry, strategy, executor);

// Register tools
registry.registerTool({
  id: 'calculator',
  name: 'Calculator',
  description: 'Performs calculations',
  category: ToolCategory.UTILITY,
  enabled: true,
  execute: async (args) => {
    // Implementation
  }
});

// Execute a tool with fallbacks
const result = await orchestrator.executeWithFallback('calculator', {
  operation: 'add',
  a: 5,
  b: 3
});

console.log(result.data); // 8
```

### Setting Fallback Strategy

```typescript
// Use similarity-based fallbacks
strategy.setStrategy(FallbackStrategy.SIMILARITY);

// Execute with performance-based fallbacks for this call only
const result = await orchestrator.executeWithFallback('calculator', args, {
  fallbackStrategy: FallbackStrategy.PERFORMANCE
});
```

### Limiting Fallbacks

```typescript
// Limit to 2 fallback attempts
const result = await orchestrator.executeWithFallback('calculator', args, {
  maxFallbacks: 2
});

// Disable fallbacks entirely
const result = await orchestrator.executeWithFallback('calculator', args, {
  disableFallbacks: true
});
```

### Getting Statistics

```typescript
// Get execution statistics
const stats = await orchestrator.getExecutionStatistics();
console.log(stats['calculator'].successRate); // 0.95

// Get execution history for a specific tool
const history = await orchestrator.getToolExecutionHistory('calculator', 10);
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Tool System include:

- AI-powered fallback selection based on tool descriptions and arguments
- Tools with streaming response support
- Distributed tool execution across workers
- Tool composition for creating pipelines
- Tool versioning for backward compatibility
- Permission-based tool access control

# Task Status Update Fix

## Problem
The agent system had an issue where tasks were not being properly marked as completed after successful execution. This resulted in a large number of "pending" tasks accumulating in the task collection, even though they had actually finished executing.

The root cause was in the task execution flow:
1. Tasks are created with status "pending"
2. When execution starts, they are updated to "in_progress"
3. After successful execution, they are supposed to be marked as "completed"
4. However, the status update to "completed" was missing in the code, causing tasks to remain in "pending" status

## Solution Status

**âœ… FIXED:** The permanent fix has been applied directly to the codebase. Tasks will now be properly marked as completed after successful execution.

## Applied Changes

The following code changes have been applied to the source code:

### In `src/agents/shared/autonomy/systems/DefaultAutonomySystem.ts`:

In the `executeTask` method, after a successful task execution:

```typescript
if (result.success) {
  taskStats.successes++;
  this.taskHistory.set(taskId, taskStats);
  
  // Added code to update task status:
  task.status = 'completed';
  task.completedAt = new Date();
  task.updatedAt = new Date();
  this.scheduledTasks.set(taskId, task);
  
  console.log(`[AutonomySystem] Task ${task.name} (${taskId}) completed successfully`);
  return true;
}
```

### In `src/lib/agents/implementations/managers/DefaultSchedulerManager.ts`:

In the `executeTask` method, after a successful task execution:

```typescript
try {
  // Existing code that calls task.execute()
  const result = await task.execute();
  
  // Added code to update task status:
  task.status = 'completed';
  task.completedAt = new Date();
  task.updatedAt = new Date();
  this.tasks.set(taskId, task);
  
  // Rest of the existing code
}
```

## Debugging Task Status Issues

To monitor task status in real-time, use:

```bash
npm run monitor
```

This will show you all tasks and their current status in the system.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing pending tasks accumulating:

1. Check that tasks are actually completing successfully (see logs for errors)
2. If all else fails, restart the system with a clean state

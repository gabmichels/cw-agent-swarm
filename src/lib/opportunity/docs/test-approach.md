# Opportunity Management System: Test Approach

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Opportunity Management System.

## 1. Testing Frameworks and Tools

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (compatible with the existing codebase)
- **Mocking**: Vitest's built-in mocking capabilities
- **Coverage**: Aim for >95% code coverage

## 2. Unit Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Component Test Coverage

Each component will have comprehensive unit tests:

- **OpportunityRegistry**: CRUD operations, filtering, agent-specific queries
- **OpportunityDetector**: Trigger detection, strategy management
- **OpportunityEvaluator**: Opportunity scoring, priority determination
- **OpportunityProcessor**: Conversion to tasks, batch processing
- **OpportunityManager**: End-to-end orchestration, agent-specific operations
- **Detection Strategies**: Strategy-specific trigger detection capabilities

### 2.2 Error Handling Tests

All error conditions and edge cases will be tested for each component:
- Invalid inputs
- Resource not found scenarios
- Permission/authorization failures
- Data validation failures
- System errors (e.g., database unavailable)

## 3. Integration Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Component Pair Integration Tests

- Detector + Registry: Storing detected opportunities
- Detector + Evaluator: Detection to evaluation flow
- Evaluator + Processor: Evaluation to task conversion
- Processor + TaskScheduler: Task creation and scheduling
- Manager + All Components: End-to-end orchestration

### 3.2 TaskScheduler Integration

- Task creation from opportunities
- Task priority inheritance
- Task metadata persistence
- Agent-specific task filtering
- Task execution feedback to opportunities

### 3.3 DateTimeProcessor Integration

- Natural language date extraction from opportunity content
- Time sensitivity determination
- Recurring opportunity scheduling
- Expiration date calculation

## 4. End-to-End Testing Strategy

Full system tests that verify the entire opportunity lifecycle:
1. Content analysis and opportunity detection
2. Opportunity evaluation and scoring
3. Task creation from opportunities
4. Task execution and result capture
5. Opportunity status updates based on task results

## 5. Performance Testing Strategy

- Load testing: Handling large volumes of opportunities
- Batch processing efficiency
- Concurrency handling
- Database query optimization
- Memory usage optimization

## 6. Mocking Strategy

- Create mock implementations for external dependencies
- Use in-memory storage for database operations
- Control date/time for predictable testing
- Simulate external events and triggers

## 7. Test Organization

```

## 8. Implementation Plan

1. Implement data model and error tests
2. Implement core component unit tests
3. Implement integration tests between components
4. Implement TaskScheduler and DateTimeProcessor integration tests
5. Implement end-to-end tests
6. Implement performance tests
7. Fix any discovered issues and improve coverage

## 9. Best Practices

- Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- Use descriptive test names following the pattern "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- Keep test code DRY with shared fixtures and setup
- Test both success and failure paths
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Maintain test isolation (no dependencies between tests)
- Use realistic test data
- Keep tests fast to encourage frequent running

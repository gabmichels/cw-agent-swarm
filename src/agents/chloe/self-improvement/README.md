# Task Outcome Analyzer

This module implements Phase 1 of the "Road to Autonomy 9.0+" for Chloe, focused on closing the feedback loop by enabling Chloe to learn from outcomes and mistakes in real-time.

## Components

### 1. TaskOutcomeAnalyzer

Automatically assesses whether a task was successful, corrected, or failed, producing a score (0-100) with detailed reasoning. It stores outcomes linked to task type, tools used, and metadata, while tracking patterns like tool misuse, misunderstandings, and unclear goals.

**Key features:**
- Task scoring system (0-100)
- Pattern identification and tracking
- Detailed outcome analysis with metadata
- Memory integration for storing outcomes

### 2. LessonExtractor

Analyzes past outcomes to extract lessons learned, tagging successful vs. failed strategies. It makes these insights available during future planning to help Chloe avoid repeated mistakes.

**Key features:**
- Automatic lesson extraction from patterns
- Categorization of lessons by type
- Success rate calculation
- Memory storage for retrieval during planning

## Integration Points

To integrate these components into Chloe's system:

### 1. Hook into Task Completion

The simplest integration is to add a single hook call at the end of task execution. The `taskCompletionHook.ts` module provides a single function for this:

```typescript
import { onTaskStateChange } from '../hooks/taskCompletionHook';

// At the end of task execution
await onTaskStateChange(task, executionTrace, memory);
```

This hook:
- Checks if the task is complete 
- Analyzes the outcome
- Stores the analysis in memory
- Occasionally extracts lessons

### 2. Apply Lessons During Planning

When planning new tasks, retrieve relevant lessons:

```typescript
import { getLessonsForTask } from '../self-improvement/taskOutcomeIntegration';

// During task planning
const relevantLessons = await getLessonsForTask(
  taskDescription, 
  taskType, 
  memory
);
```

## Example Usage

See example implementations in:
- `test-task-outcome.ts` - Demonstrates the analyzers in action
- `task-outcome-analyzer-integration.ts` - Shows integration points

## Success Metrics

The implementation aims to achieve:
- 85% of completed tasks are auto-scored
- 30% reduction in repeated correction types over time
- Ability to retrieve 3+ relevant lessons during planning

## Running Tests

To run the test examples:

```bash
# From the project root
npx ts-node src/agents/chloe/self-improvement/test-task-outcome.ts

# Run the integration example
npx ts-node src/agents/chloe/integration-examples/task-outcome-analyzer-integration.ts
```

## Future Work

Phase 2 will focus on:
- Enhancing the lesson extraction with more sophisticated pattern recognition
- Implementing automatic correction strategies based on past lessons
- Adding real-time feedback during task execution

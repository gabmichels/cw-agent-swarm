# Robust Safeguards Implementation

This document explains the implementation of Robust Safeguards for the Chloe agent system, including comprehensive resource monitoring, enhanced circuit breaker implementation, task validation, and cleanup mechanisms.

## Overview

The Robust Safeguards system provides several key protection mechanisms:

1. **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks CPU usage, memory usage, active tasks, and message count to prevent system overload.
2. **Enhanced Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures by stopping operations that repeatedly fail.
3. **Task Validation**: Ensures tasks and plans meet validation requirements before execution.
4. **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Manages cleanup operations to free resources after task execution.

## Implementation Details

### Resource Monitoring

The system monitors:
- Memory usage (heap used vs. heap total)
- CPU usage (platform-specific implementation)
- Active task count
- Message count

Resource limits are configurable:
- Maximum memory usage: 80% by default
- Maximum CPU usage: 70% by default
- Maximum active tasks: 20 by default
- Maximum message count: 10,000 by default

### Enhanced Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker has three states:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, allowing execution
- **Open**: Too many failures have occurred, blocking execution
- **Half-Open**: Testing if execution can resume after a timeout

Key features:
- Failure counting with configurable thresholds
- Automatic reset after timeout
- Half-open state to test recovery
- Optional timeout for operations
- Fallback values in case of failure

### Task Validation

Task validation ensures that:
- Tasks have valid IDs
- Tasks include descriptions
- Plan steps are well-defined
- Resources are available for execution

### Cleanup Mechanisms

The cleanup system:
- Registers cleanup tasks by resource type
- Prioritizes cleanup operations (high, medium, low)
- Executes cleanup after task completion
- Supports batch cleanup operations

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { RobustSafeguards } from './robustSafeguards';
import { TaskLogger } from '../task-logger';

// Initialize
const taskLogger = new TaskLogger();
const safeguards = new RobustSafeguards(taskLogger);

// Check resource limits
const withinLimits = await safeguards.checkResourceLimits();

// Execute with circuit breaker
const result = await safeguards.executeWithCircuitBreaker(
  'operation_name',
  async () => {
    // Your operation here
    return result;
  },
  {
    timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
    fallback: { success: false, message: 'Operation timed out' }
  }
);

// Register cleanup task
const cleanupId = safeguards.registerCleanupTask(
  'Cleanup database connections',
  ['connections', 'memory'],
  'high'
);

// Execute cleanup
await safeguards.executeCleanupTask(cleanupId);
```

### Integration with ChloeAgent

For integrating with the ChloeAgent, see the `safeguardsIntegration.ts` file which provides helper functions and examples.

Example task execution with safeguards:

```typescript
import { executeTaskWithSafeguards } from './safeguardsIntegration';

// In your agent code
async function runTask(task) {
  return executeTaskWithSafeguards(
    task,
    async () => {
      // Your task execution logic
      return result;
    },
    this.taskLogger
  );
}
```

## Configuration

The RobustSafeguards class accepts the following configuration options:

```typescript
// Custom thresholds
safeguards.MAX_MEMORY_USAGE = 0.9; // 90% instead of default 80%
safeguards.MAX_CPU_USAGE = 0.8; // 80% instead of default 70%
safeguards.CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 10; // 10 failures instead of default 5
safeguards.CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_TIMEOUT = 60000; // 60 seconds instead of default 30
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

The system provides monitoring capabilities:

```typescript
// Get current resource metrics
const metrics = await safeguards.monitorResources();

// Get system status report
const report = safeguards.getStatusReport();
console.log(`Memory usage: ${report.resourceMetrics.memoryUsage * 100}%`);
console.log(`Circuit breakers: ${report.circuitBreakers.length}`);
console.log(`Pending cleanup tasks: ${report.pendingCleanupTasks}`);
```

## Best Practices

1. Always register cleanup tasks when starting operations that allocate resources
2. Use appropriate timeouts for circuit breaker operations
3. Validate tasks and plans before execution
4. Monitor resource usage regularly
5. Execute cleanup tasks after completion, even if operations fail
6. Use appropriate priority levels for cleanup tasks
7. Implement platform-specific resource monitoring for best results

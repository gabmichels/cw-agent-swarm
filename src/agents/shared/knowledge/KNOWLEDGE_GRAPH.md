# Knowledge Graph Interface

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph interface provides a comprehensive framework for representing, querying, and analyzing structured knowledge in agent architectures. It enables agents to build and maintain a semantic network of interconnected concepts, entities, and relationships that can be used for enhanced decision-making, planning, and reasoning.

## Core Components

### 1. Knowledge Node Types

The system supports a rich taxonomy of node types:

```typescript
export enum KnowledgeNodeType {
  TASK = 'task',           // Tasks or activities
  CONCEPT = 'concept',     // Conceptual knowledge
  TREND = 'trend',         // Trends or patterns
  TOOL = 'tool',           // Tool or capability
  STRATEGY = 'strategy',   // Strategic approaches
  INSIGHT = 'insight',     // Insights or learnings
  PROJECT = 'project',     // Project information
  AGENT = 'agent',         // Agent entities
  ENTITY = 'entity',       // General entities
  PROCESS = 'process',     // Processes or workflows
  RESOURCE = 'resource',   // Resources
  METRIC = 'metric',       // Metrics or measurements
  EVENT = 'event',         // Events
  DECISION = 'decision'    // Decisions
}
```

### 2. Knowledge Edge Types

Relationships between nodes are expressed through typed edges:

```typescript
export enum KnowledgeEdgeType {
  RELATED_TO = 'related_to',      // General relationship
  DEPENDS_ON = 'depends_on',      // Dependency relationship
  CONTRADICTS = 'contradicts',    // Contradiction
  SUPPORTS = 'supports',          // Supporting evidence
  USED_BY = 'used_by',            // Usage relationship
  REPORTED_BY = 'reported_by',    // Source of information
  PRODUCED_BY = 'produced_by',    // Production relationship
  PART_OF = 'part_of',            // Component relationship
  LEADS_TO = 'leads_to',          // Causal relationship
  SIMILAR_TO = 'similar_to',      // Similarity
  DERIVED_FROM = 'derived_from',  // Derivation
  INFLUENCES = 'influences',      // Influence relationship
  CATEGORIZES = 'categorizes',    // Categorization
  REFERENCES = 'references'       // Reference relationship
}
```

## Key Features

### Basic Knowledge Graph Operations

- **Node Management**: Add, retrieve, update, and delete nodes
- **Edge Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete relationships between nodes
- **Graph Traversal**: Navigate the graph structure through relationships
- **Path Finding**: Discover paths between nodes in the graph

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extract structured knowledge from unstructured content
- **Graph Intelligence**: Generate insights, patterns, and recommendations from the graph
- **Inference**: Infer new relationships based on existing knowledge
- **Visualization**: Generate visualization-ready data structures

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing the KnowledgeGraph interface, consider the following best practices:

1. **Efficiency**: Optimize for common operations like node retrieval and traversal
2. **Scalability**: Design for growth in both node count and relationship complexity
3. **Consistency**: Maintain referential integrity between nodes and edges
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system for robust implementations
5. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for failed operations

## Usage Examples

### Building a Knowledge Graph

```typescript
// Initialize the graph
const graph = new DefaultKnowledgeGraph();
await graph.initialize();

// Add nodes
const conceptId = await graph.addNode({
  label: 'Artificial Intelligence',
  type: KnowledgeNodeType.CONCEPT,
  description: 'The simulation of human intelligence in machines',
  tags: ['technology', 'computer science']
});

const subtopicId = await graph.addNode({
  label: 'Machine Learning',
  type: KnowledgeNodeType.CONCEPT,
  description: 'The study of algorithms that improve through experience',
  tags: ['ai', 'data science']
});

// Add relationships
await graph.addEdge({
  from: subtopicId,
  to: conceptId,
  type: KnowledgeEdgeType.PART_OF,
  label: 'Is a sub-field of',
  strength: 0.9
});
```

### Querying the Graph

```typescript
// Find nodes by keyword
const results = await graph.findNodes('learning', {
  nodeTypes: [KnowledgeNodeType.CONCEPT],
  limit: 5
});

// Find paths between nodes
const paths = await graph.findPaths({
  startNodeId: 'node-1',
  targetNodeId: 'node-2',
  maxLength: 3
});

// Generate insights
const insights = await graph.generateInsights({
  focusNodeIds: ['node-1', 'node-2'],
  insightTypes: ['pattern', 'recommendation']
});
```

### Knowledge Extraction

```typescript
// Extract knowledge from content
const extractionResult = await graph.extractKnowledge({
  content: 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming industries...',
  nodeTypes: [KnowledgeNodeType.CONCEPT, KnowledgeNodeType.TREND],
  minConfidence: 0.7
});

// Build graph from memories
await graph.buildGraph({
  memories: agent.getRecentMemories(10),
  tasks: agent.getActiveTasks()
});
```

## Integration with Other Systems

The Knowledge Graph interface is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the agent architecture:

- **Memory System**: Build knowledge graphs from agent memories
- **Planning System**: Use graph context for enhanced planning
- **Reflection System**: Analyze graph patterns during reflection
- **Learning System**: Update the graph as the agent learns

## Test Coverage

The Knowledge Graph implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Basic node and edge operations
- Graph traversal and path finding
- Knowledge extraction and inference
- Graph intelligence and insight generation

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to consider for future versions:

1. **Distributed Graph Support**: Enable sharing and federation across agent networks
2. **Temporal Graphs**: Add support for time-based evolution of knowledge
3. **Uncertainty Handling**: Improve representation of uncertain or probabilistic knowledge
4. **Graph Learning**: Enable the graph to learn and evolve relationship strengths based on usage
5. **Advanced Visualization**: Add support for more sophisticated visualization techniques

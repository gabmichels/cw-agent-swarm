# Knowledge Extension Interfaces

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Knowledge Extension Interfaces implemented as part of Phase 6.5 of the Agent Refactoring project. These interfaces enhance the agent architecture with systematic knowledge acquisition, validation, and integration capabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. Knowledge Acquisition System

The Knowledge Acquisition system provides a structured approach to gathering, validating, and integrating new knowledge into an agent's knowledge base.

#### Core Interfaces:

- `KnowledgeAcquisition`: Primary interface for knowledge acquisition operations
- `KnowledgeAcquisitionTask`: Interface representing a knowledge acquisition task
- `KnowledgeSource`: Information source representation
- `KnowledgeAcquisitionResult`: Result of an acquisition operation
- `KnowledgeIntegrationResult`: Result of integrating acquired knowledge

#### Key Features:

- **Source Management**: Registration and management of knowledge sources with reliability scoring
- **Task Lifecycle**: Comprehensive task management from creation to execution and integration
- **Validation Requirements**: Configurable validation levels and methods for acquired knowledge
- **Confidence Tracking**: Confidence scoring and classification for knowledge entries
- **Integration Impact Assessment**: Measuring the impact of new knowledge on the existing knowledge base

### 2. Knowledge Validation System

The Knowledge Validation system ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of knowledge before it's integrated into the agent's knowledge base.

#### Core Interfaces:

- `KnowledgeValidation`: Primary interface for knowledge validation operations
- `ValidationMethod`: Interface representing a validation method
- `ValidationRequest`: Interface representing a validation request
- `ValidationResult`: Result of a validation operation with detailed metrics

#### Key Features:

- **Method Registry**: Registration and discovery of validation methods
- **Multi-step Validation**: Support for multiple validation steps with individual results
- **Issue Tracking**: Detailed tracking of validation issues with severity levels
- **Correction Mechanisms**: Suggested corrections for identified issues
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics for validation operations
- **Direct Validation**: Convenience method for immediate validation of knowledge

## Implementation Status

Both the Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Validation interfaces have been fully implemented, with comprehensive test coverage to ensure interface contract compliance. Mock implementations demonstrate the expected behavior and serve as a reference for concrete implementations.

### Completed Items:

- ✅ Interface definitions following interface-first design principles
- ✅ Comprehensive enum types for validation methods, confidence levels, etc.
- ✅ Detailed result types with metrics and issue tracking
- ✅ Test suite with mock implementations
- ✅ Index exports for easy import

### Next Steps:

- Implement DefaultKnowledgeAcquisitionManager
- Implement DefaultKnowledgeValidationManager
- Create knowledge prioritization interfaces
- Enhance integration with the existing knowledge management system

## Design Principles

The implementation follows these key design principles:

1. **Interface-First Design**: Clearly defined interfaces before implementation
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type definitions with no use of `any`
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between acquisition and validation
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Detailed metrics for all operations
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with new validation methods and acquisition strategies

## Usage Examples

### Knowledge Acquisition

```typescript
// Create a knowledge acquisition task
const task = await knowledgeAcquisition.createAcquisitionTask(
  'Gather information about TypeScript generics',
  {
    priority: 0.8,
    validationRequirements: {
      requiredLevel: KnowledgeValidationLevel.THOROUGH,
      methods: ['fact_check', 'cross_reference'],
      minimumConfidence: 0.85
    }
  }
);

// Execute the task
const result = await knowledgeAcquisition.executeAcquisitionTask(task.id);

// Integrate the acquired knowledge
const integrationResult = await knowledgeAcquisition.integrateAcquiredKnowledge(
  result.taskId
);
```

### Knowledge Validation

```typescript
// Register a validation method
const method = await knowledgeValidation.registerValidationMethod({
  name: 'Cross Reference',
  type: ValidationMethodType.CROSS_REFERENCE,
  description: 'Validates knowledge by cross-referencing with multiple sources',
  parameters: { minSources: 3 },
  reliability: 0.9,
  achievableValidationLevels: [
    KnowledgeValidationLevel.MODERATE,
    KnowledgeValidationLevel.THOROUGH
  ]
});

// Validate knowledge directly
const result = await knowledgeValidation.validateKnowledge(
  'TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.',
  {
    requiredLevel: KnowledgeValidationLevel.MODERATE,
    methodIds: [method.id]
  }
);
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Knowledge Acquisition and Validation interfaces are designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing KnowledgeManager interface, providing enhanced capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the base agent architecture.

The interfaces complement the CognitiveMemory capabilities by providing systematic knowledge management that can leverage the enhanced memory features for knowledge representation and retrieval.

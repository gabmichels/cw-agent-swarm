# Discord Notification System Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive Discord notification system for Chloe that provides two methods of notification:

1. **Channel Webhook Notifications**: Sends messages to a Discord channel
2. **Direct Message Notifications**: Sends private messages to users via a Discord bot

The system includes automatic intent detection, which can recognize when Chloe mentions notifying the user (e.g., "I'll let you know when I'm done").

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Configuration Settings** (`apps/agents/shared/config.py`):
   - Environment variables for Discord webhook URL, bot token, and user ID
   - Toggle for auto-notification when intent is detected
   - List of notification phrases to detect intent
   - `has_notification_intent()` function to check messages

2. **Discord Notification Tool** (`apps/agents/shared/tools/discord_notify.py`):
   - Implementation of Discord bot for direct messaging
   - Functions to send direct messages to users

3. **Integration with Perception Tools** (`apps/agents/shared/tools/perception_tools.py`):
   - Updated to check for notification intent in agent responses
   - Added support for different notification methods
   - Enhanced messaging to inform users about notifications

4. **Integration with CMO Tools** (`apps/agents/shared/tools/cmo_tools.py`):
   - Added support for passing agent responses for intent detection
   - Updated to use default notification settings when available

5. **Testing and Examples**:
   - Created `test_notification_intent.py` to test intent detection and notification
   - Added `env_example.txt` as a template for environment variables
   - Comprehensive README explaining the notification system

## How It Works

1. When Chloe mentions that she'll notify the user (e.g., "I'll let you know when I'm done"), the system automatically detects this intent.
2. If auto-notifications are enabled, the system will send a notification when the data collection task completes.
3. The notification will be sent via the preferred method (webhook or direct message).
4. Users can also explicitly request notifications by setting `notify_discord=True` in the API calls.

## Configuration Required

To use the notification system, users need to add the following to their `.env` file:

```
# For channel webhook notifications
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-id/your-webhook-token

# For direct message notifications
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
DEFAULT_DISCORD_USER_ID=your-discord-user-id

# Enable automatic notifications when intent is detected
ENABLE_AUTO_NOTIFICATIONS=1
```

## Testing

The system includes test scripts to verify functionality:

- `test_notification_intent.py`: Tests intent detection and both notification methods
- `simple_intent_test.py`: Simple test focusing just on intent detection

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Supporting additional notification channels (email, SMS, etc.)
2. Enhanced formatting of notifications with rich embeds
3. Interactive buttons/components in Discord messages
4. Notification preferences stored in user profiles
5. Scheduled/delayed notifications

## ðŸ§­ Phase 1: Observability & Memory Maturity (Weeks 1â€“2)  
**Goal:** Turn the platform from robust to fully observable, auditable, and self-aware.

âœ… Agent Dashboard UI  
âœ… Memory Layer Upgrade  
âœ… Ethics Middleware v1

## ðŸ§­ Phase 2: Execution Resilience + Coordination Scaling (Weeks 3â€“5)  
**Goal:** Prepare the system for intelligent task routing under load.

âœ… Execution Hardening  
âœ… Coordinator Health & Capability

## ðŸ§­ Phase 3: MCP Runtime Layer (Weeks 6â€“7)  
**Goal:** Introduce orchestration, modularity, and runtime control across all agents.

âœ… Agent Capability Discovery  
- Implemented `AgentCapabilityRegistry`  
- Extended `AgentBase` with capabilities, roles, tags  
- Integrated dynamic matching into `AgentCoordinator`  
- Created standard skill definitions and demo suite  
- Documented matching system and future extensibility  

ðŸ”œ Task: Agent Control Plane Setup  
- Create `MCPRuntime.ts` for registration, routing, and lifecycle  
- Centralize registry of active/idle/failed agents  

ðŸ”œ Task: Global Task Routing  
- Dispatch tasks via MCP based on skill, load, health  

ðŸ”œ Task: Scalable Agent Bootstrapping  
- Chloe suggests new agents  
- UI generates config stubs + MD docs  
- MCP supports spawning + onboarding flows

## ðŸ§­ Phase 4: Analytics + Governance (Post-MCP, Optional Weeks 8â€“9)  
**Goal:** Expand from introspection to intelligence + oversight.

ðŸ”œ AgentMonitor Storage + AgentStats  
ðŸ”œ Ethical Governance Layer

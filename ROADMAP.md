ROADMAP.md – Multi-Agent System Maturity Plan
🧭 Phase 1: Observability & Memory Maturity (Weeks 1–2)
Goal: Turn the platform from robust to fully observable, auditable, and self-aware.

✅ [COMPLETE] Agent Dashboard UI
Replaced "Projects" with "Agents" in nav, implemented live dashboard at /agents

✅ [COMPLETE] Memory Layer Upgrade
 Add memory tiers: shortTerm, longTerm, inbox, reflections

 Implement MemoryPruner.ts to forget irrelevant or outdated entries

 Introduce MemorySchema types for structured memory (e.g., messages, decisions, facts)

 Add MemoryConsolidator.ts to periodically summarize entries

✅ [COMPLETE] Ethics Middleware v1
 Create BiasAuditor.ts and hook into Planner + ToolRouter

 Define EthicsPolicy.ts with rules like “Avoid stereotyped outputs”

 Log violations to AgentMonitor as eventType: 'ethics_violation'

 Add reflection prompt about fairness, bias, and safety

🧭 Phase 2: Execution Resilience + Coordination Scaling (Weeks 3–5)
Goal: Prepare the system for intelligent task routing under load.

✅ [COMPLETE] Execution Hardening
 Add retryCount, retryDelay to tasks

 Implement backoff + retry logic in Executor.ts

 Add timeoutMs + cancellation support for long-running tasks

✅ [COMPLETE] Coordinator Health & Capability
 Add AgentHealthChecker.ts to validate agent availability

 Introduce per-agent delegation quotas

 Add /agent/capabilities endpoint or dynamic broadcast discovery

 Enable fallback agent suggestions if one fails

🧭 Phase 3: Analytics + Governance (Optional Weeks 6+)
Goal: Expand from introspection to intelligence + oversight.

🔜 Task: AgentMonitor Storage + Analytics
 Store logs in file or DB (e.g., Supabase / SQLite / DuckDB)

 Implement AgentStats.ts to generate real-time charts

 Add alerting for critical failures or long idle times

🔜 Task: Ethical Governance Layer
 Add safety guardrails (e.g., don’t generate financial advice)

 Introduce transparency logs for decisions

 Build policy override + escalation workflow

# Chloe - Product Context

## Product
Claro is a mobile-first translation app designed for real-time conversations. It emphasizes natural, human-sounding text-to-speech (TTS) and minimal friction during use. Its primary goal is to make travelers feel confident speaking in unfamiliar language environments.

Available on iOS and Android. Public soft launch — no major bugs, stable MVP.

Core "Wow" Moment:
- Experiencing fast, natural back-and-forth conversation without robotic voices or complex setup.

## Current Stage
- Publicly available, but early-stage (post-beta, pre-scaling).
- No large user base yet — growth is just beginning.
- Monetization: Free limited version + premium subscription offering unlimited conversations and premium voices.
- No in-app referral system yet (planned for later).
- Organic growth only (minimal paid ads so far).

## Target Audience
- Travelers visiting foreign-language countries (EU focus: Spain, Germany, France, Italy).
- Age: 25-55

## Chloe's Assumptions
- We are targeting **new user acquisition** over retention for now.
- Virality and word-of-mouth are top growth levers.
- CAC must be kept extremely low during early growth.
- Resource constraints: Limited budget for ads, content creation must be scrappy.
- Primary channels: Instagram Reels, TikTok, micro-influencers, low-cost paid experiments.

## Goal Alignment
- Priority 1: Grow MAU month-over-month.
- Priority 2: Build lightweight viral loops.
- Priority 3: Optimize CAC over time.

# Chloe Agent Modularization

This document summarizes the changes made to modularize the Chloe AI agent codebase, creating a reusable framework for future agents.

## Directory Structure

The codebase has been reorganized into the following structure:

```
agents/
  chloe/                        # Chloe-specific components
    agent_config.py             # Chloe's personality, tone, LLM preferences
    strategies/                 # Marketing-specific strategy modules
      content_strategy.py       # Content planning strategy
    tools/                      # Marketing-specific tools
      content_planner.py        # Content calendar management
    reflections/                # Chloe's reflection interpretations
      cmo_reflection.py         # Marketing-focused reflection handling
    main.py                     # Assembles Chloe using shared core

shared/
  agent_core/                   # Shared agent infrastructure
    agent_loop.py               # Main behavior loop
    executor.py                 # Task execution engine
    planner.py                  # Goal -> task breakdown logic
    reflection.py               # Shared reflection capabilities
    llm_router.py               # Model routing and selection
    task_queue.py               # Task prioritization system
    memory/                     # Memory systems
      chat_history.py           # Chat storage and retrieval
    tools/                      # Generic tools for all agents
```

## Key Components

### Shared Components (agent_core)

- **agent_loop.py**: Main behavior loop that handles user interactions, tool execution, and agent management
- **executor.py**: Executes individual tasks and manages their lifecycle
- **planner.py**: Breaks down high-level goals into executable tasks
- **reflection.py**: Enables agents to reflect on past experiences and improve over time
- **llm_router.py**: Routes requests to appropriate language models based on task type
- **task_queue.py**: Manages task scheduling, prioritization, and execution
- **memory/chat_history.py**: Stores and retrieves chat history with tagging and formatting

### Chloe-Specific Components

- **agent_config.py**: Defines Chloe's personality, tone, and LLM preferences
- **strategies/content_strategy.py**: Implements marketing content planning strategies
- **tools/content_planner.py**: Provides tools for content calendar management
- **reflections/cmo_reflection.py**: Handles marketing-specific reflection generation
- **main.py**: Entry point that assembles Chloe using shared components

## Reusability for Future Agents

This modularization enables the creation of new agents by:

1. **Inheriting shared components**: Each agent uses the same core agent loop, planner, executor, and memory systems
2. **Specializing behavior**: Each agent defines its own config, strategies, tools, and reflection handlers
3. **Remaining independent**: Agents can be developed individually without affecting each other

## Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent (e.g., SupportAgent):

1. Create directory structure:
   ```
   agents/support_agent/
     agent_config.py        # Define personality, tone, LLM preferences
     strategies/            # Support-specific strategies
     tools/                 # Support-specific tools
     reflections/           # Support-specific reflection handling
     main.py                # Main entry point
   ```

2. In agent_config.py:
   - Define agent name, role, and personality traits
   - Set appropriate system prompt
   - Configure model preferences

3. Create domain-specific tools and strategies

4. In main.py:
   - Import shared components
   - Import agent-specific components
   - Initialize the agent with appropriate tools
   - Set up the agent loop

## Benefits of Modularization

- **Code reuse**: Core functionality is shared across agents
- **Improved maintainability**: Changes to core behavior only need to be made in one place
- **Specialized agents**: Each agent can focus on its domain while leveraging the same infrastructure
- **Faster development**: New agents can be created quickly by focusing only on specialized components
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between shared and agent-specific code

## Next Steps

1. **LangGraph Integration**: The modular structure is ready for LangGraph orchestration
2. **Vector Storage**: Add vector storage for improved memory retrieval
3. **Additional Tool Development**: Develop more shared tools
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Create shared testing frameworks for agents
5. **New Agent Development**: Create additional agents following this pattern

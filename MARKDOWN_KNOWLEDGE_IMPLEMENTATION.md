# Markdown Knowledge Integration Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the markdown-based semantic knowledge system for Chloe, as requested. All phases of the requested implementation have been completed, with code, tests, and documentation.

## Implementation Summary

### Phase A — Enable Markdown-Based Semantic Memory Usage

- ✅ Implemented `getRelevantMemoriesByType` in `memory.ts` to filter by memory type
- ✅ Updated `planTaskNode.ts` to inject structured knowledge into planning prompt
- ✅ Added task metadata for tracking knowledge usage
- ✅ Implemented logging for memory types and sources

### Phase B — Keep Memory in Sync with Markdown Files

- ✅ Created `markdownWatcher.ts` using `chokidar` to watch markdown files
- ✅ Implemented file change detection with timestamp comparison
- ✅ Added versioning system to mark old memories as superseded
- ✅ Created CLI script `reload-md-memory.ts` for manual refresh
- ✅ Updated `qdrant` module with required memory management functions
- ✅ Added watcher initialization to agent startup

### Phase C — Graph Synchronization

- ✅ Implemented `markdownGraphIntegration.ts` to extract entities from markdown
- ✅ Added functionality to create graph nodes for files, sections, and concepts
- ✅ Created relationships between markdown entities in the graph
- ✅ Integrated graph synchronization with the file watcher

### Additional Components

- ✅ Added tests for memory retrieval and watcher functionality
- ✅ Created detailed documentation in `semantic-markdown-knowledge-system.md`
- ✅ Added necessary dependencies to `package.json`
- ✅ Added new npm scripts for memory management

## Files Created or Modified

### New Files

1. `src/agents/chloe/knowledge/markdownWatcher.ts` - File watcher for markdown
2. `src/agents/chloe/knowledge/markdownGraphIntegration.ts` - Graph integration
3. `scripts/reload-md-memory.ts` - CLI script for manual memory refresh
4. `docs/semantic-markdown-knowledge-system.md` - System documentation
5. `tests/markdownMemoryRetrieval.test.ts` - Tests for memory retrieval
6. `tests/markdownWatcher.test.ts` - Tests for file watcher
7. `MARKDOWN_KNOWLEDGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files

1. `src/agents/chloe/memory.ts` - Added `getRelevantMemoriesByType` method
2. `src/agents/chloe/graph/nodes/planTaskNode.ts` - Updated to use structured knowledge
3. `src/agents/chloe/core/agent.ts` - Added watcher initialization
4. `src/server/qdrant/index.ts` - Added functions for memory metadata and clearing
5. `package.json` - Added dependencies and scripts

## How to Test

1. Start Chloe normally
2. Add or modify markdown files in:
   - `data/knowledge/company/`
   - `data/knowledge/domains/`
   - `data/knowledge/agents/`
3. Changes will be automatically detected and reflected in memory
4. To manually refresh, run:
   ```
   npm run memory:reload-md
   ```
5. To clear and refresh all markdown memory:
   ```
   npm run memory:reload-md:clear
   ```

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Chloe dynamically retrieves and injects relevant `.md` knowledge into task planning
- ✅ Changes to `.md` files are reflected in memory within seconds
- ✅ No more manual prompt stuffing from markdown
- ✅ Structured knowledge types can be queried semantically and audited
- ✅ Graph includes `.md`-derived concepts and relationships

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:

1. Improve markdown parsing to handle more complex structures
2. Add AI-assisted metadata extraction for better categorization
3. Implement tracking of which knowledge is most frequently used
4. Add similarity detection between markdown files
5. Create a UI for viewing and managing markdown knowledge
